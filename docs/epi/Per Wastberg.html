                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Sound the depths, to ascertain where you are; observe the visible signs in the atmosphere, to ascertain what weather awaits you. But don't dive to the bottom; you will never reach it. Don't rise in an airship to the ether, that uttermost limit of the Earth; you will never reach it. Everything below is cold and dead; everything above is cold and dead. The warmth of life is only to be found on the surface of the Earth.</i></b>
