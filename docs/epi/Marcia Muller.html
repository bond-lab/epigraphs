                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the broken promise land
They tell you you're in big demand
But come the brutal light of day
The dreams you have just slip away 

They lure you with their talk of fame
They swear you're sure to make a name
The lies you're living take their toll
And in the end they own your soul

In the broken promise land
They make you jump at their command
They use you up, throw you away
And soon your hopes are yesterday</i></b>
