<li>IN: <i>The Memory Room</i> (2007) Fiction, Australian
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Two friends who met here and embraced are gone,
Each to his own mistake; one flashes on
To fame and ruin in a rowdy lie,
A village torpor holds the other one,
Some local wrong where it takes time to die:
This empty junction glitters in the sun.

So at all quays and crossroad: who can tell
These places of decision and farewell
To what dishonour all adventure leads,
What parting gift could give that friend protection,
So orientated his vocation needs
The Bad Lands and the sinister direction?</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Crossroads</i>,  (1941), Poem, US/England
