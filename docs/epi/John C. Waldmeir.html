                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We Catholics are very much given to the Instant Answer. Fiction doesn't have any. It leaves us, like Job, with a renewed sense of mystery. This is what the fiction writer, on his lesser level, hopes to do. The danger for the writer who is surred by the religious view of the world is that he will consider this to be two operations instead of one. He will try to enshrine the mystery without the fact, and there will follow a further set of separatons which are inimical to art. Judgement will be separated from vision, nature from grace, and reason from imagination.</i></b>
