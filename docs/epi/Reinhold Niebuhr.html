                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>God, grant me the serenity
To accept the things I cannot change, 
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference. 

Living one day at a time;
Enjoying one moment at a time;
Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;
Taking, as He did, this sinful world
As it is, not as I would have it.

Trusting that He will make all things right
If I surrender to His will
That I may be reasonably happy in this life
And supremely happy with Him
Forever in the next.

Amen.</i></b>
