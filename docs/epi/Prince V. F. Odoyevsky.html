                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Oh, those storytellers! They can't rest content with writhing something useful, agreeable, palatable - they have to dig up all the earth's most cherished secrets! .... I'd forbid them to write, that's what I'd do! I mean, have you ever known the like? A man reads... and finds himself reflecting - and before he knows where he is, all kinds of rubbish come into his head. I'd forbid them to write, truly I would; forbid them to write altogether!</i></b>
