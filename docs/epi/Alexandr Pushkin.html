                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And in the moonlight's pallid glamour
Rides high upon the charging brute
Head held high 'mid echoing clamour
The Bronze Horseman in pursuit.

And all through that long night no matter
What road the frantic wretch might take
There would pound with ponderous clatter
The Bronze Horseman in his wake.</i></b>
