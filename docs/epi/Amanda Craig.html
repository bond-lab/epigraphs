                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside... But look at these lovely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.</i></b>

Of that huge city, oftentimes was seen
Affectingly set forth, more than elsewhere
Is possible, the unity of men,
One spirit over ignorance and vice
Predominant, in good and evil hearts
One sense for moral judgements, as one eye
For the sun's light...</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Unreal City,
Under the brown fog of a winter down,
A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
I had not thought death had undone so many.
Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Midway upon the journey of our life
I found that I had strayed into a wood
So dark the right road was completely lost.
How hard a thing it is for me to tell
Of that wild wood, so rugged and so harsh --
The very thought of it renews my fear!
So bitter it is, death were hardly worse.
But to explain the good I found therein
I will relate the other things I saw.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My mother said, I never should
Play with the gypsies in the wood;
If I did, she would say,
Naughty girl to disobey.
Your hair shan't curl,
Your shoes shan't shine,
You naughty girl you shan't be mine.
The wood was dark, the grass was green,
Up comes Sally with a tambourine.
I went to the river -- no ship to get across,
I paid ten dollars for an old white horse,
I up on his back and off in a crack --
Sally, tell my mother I shall never come back.</i></b>

And maidens call it love-in-idleness.</i></b>
