                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>To you this tale refers,
Who seek to lead your mind
Into the upper day,
For he who overcomes should
Turn back his gaze
Toward the Tartarean cave,
Whatever excellence he takes with him
He loses when he looks below.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy</i>,  (524), Book, Italy
