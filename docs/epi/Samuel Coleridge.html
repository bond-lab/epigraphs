                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Why do you make a book? Because my Hands can extend but few score Inches from my body; because my poverty keeps those Hands empty when my Heart aches to empty them; because my Life is short, and my Infirmities; and beacause a Book, if it extendsbut to one Edition, will probably benefit three or four on whom I could not otherwise have acted...

The sphere of Alexander the Great's Agency is trifling compared with it.</i></b>

 And what if

 You had that flower in you hand 
 Ah, what then?</i></b>
