                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Whoso beset him round / With dismal stores, / Do but themselves confound; / His strength the more is. / No lion can him fright, / He'll with a giant fight, / But he will have a right / To be a pilgrim. / Hobgoblin nor foul fiend / Can daunt his spirit; / He knows he at the end / Shall life inhereit. / Then fancies fly away, / He'll fear not what men say, / He'll labour night and day / To be a pilgrim.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>To Be a Pilgrim</i>,  (1678), Hymn, UK
