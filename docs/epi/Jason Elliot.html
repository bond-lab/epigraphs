                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Look at the inmost causes of things, stripped of their husks; note the intentions that underlie actions, study the essence of pain, pleasure, death, glory; observe how man's disquiet is all of his own making, and how troubles come never from another's hand, but like all else are creatures of our own opinion.</i></b>
