                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Mangledore / man-gul-dore / 'man-gluh-dore/
n. The cleanly severed, pickled hand of a convicted, executed criminal, in particular a murderer. The pickling process varies from region to region, but most often involves brown vinegar, sesame seeds and zimort. It is common practice for the fingers to be fixed around a candle (made from the rendered fat of a dead man), but occasionally the index finger is threaded with a wick.Once alight the candle ensures that all sleeping members of a household remain in a state of lethargic somnolence, thus enabling the holder to burgle without fear of discovery. The candle can be quenched only by milk.</i></b>
