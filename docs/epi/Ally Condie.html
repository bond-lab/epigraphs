                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Do not go gentle into that good night, / Old age should burn and rage at close of day; / Rage, rage against the dying of the light. / Though wise men at their end know dark is right, / Because theirs words had forked no lightning they / Do not go gentle into that good night. / Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright / Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, / Rage, rage against the dying of the light. / WIld men who caught and sang the sun in flight, / And learn , too late, they grieved it on its way, / Do not go gentle into that good night. / Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight / Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, / Rage, rage against the dying of the light. / And you, my father, there on the sad height, / Curse, bless me now with you fierce tears, I pray. / Do not go gentle into that good night. / Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Sunset and evening star, / And one clear call for me! / And may there be no moaning of the bar, / When I put out to sea. / But such a tide as moving seems asleep, / Too full for sound and foam, / When that which drew from out the boundless deep / Turns again home. / Twilight and evening bell, / And after that the dark! / And may there be no sadness of farewell, / When I embark; / For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place / The flood may bear me far, / I hope to see my Pilot face to face / When I have crossed the bar.</i></b>
