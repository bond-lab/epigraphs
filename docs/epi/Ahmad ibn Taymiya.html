                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>If a Muslim is fighting or travelling in pagan territory, he has no obligation to appear differently from those around him. In such circumstances, Muslims may prefer or be obliged to adopt a similar appearance, always provided that this supposes a religious benefit, such as being able to preach to the infidel, discover their secrets and transmit them to other Muslims, to avert harm, or for any other useful end.</i></b>
