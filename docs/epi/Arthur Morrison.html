                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>... Woe unto the foolish prophets, that
follow their own spirit, and have seen
nothing!...
Because, even because they have seduced
my people, saying, Peace; and there
was no peace; and one built up a
wall, and lo, others daubed it with
untempered mortar:
Say unto them which daub it with untempered
mortar, that it shall fall:
there shall be an overflowing shower;
and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall;
and a stormy wind shall rend it.
Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not
be said unto you, Where is the daubing
wherewith ye have daubed it?â€”</i></b>
