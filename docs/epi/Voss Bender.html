                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>What cane be said about Ambergris that has not already been said? Every minute section of the city, no matter how seemingly superfluous, has a complex, even devious, part to play in the communal life. And no matter how often I stroll down Albumuth Boulevard, I never lose my sense of the city's incomparable splendor -- its love of ritual, its passion for music, its infinite capacity for the beautiful cruelty.</i></b>
