                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,
For that they will not intercept my tale:
When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Titus Andronicus, Act 3, Scene 1</i>,  (1594), Play, UK
