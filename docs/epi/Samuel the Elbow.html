                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A shaman? A shaman is the knower of the path, the seer of truth, the wanderer of the hidden ways. The dude who is in the know, the one who sees what the kids are too dumb to look at. To put it in little words so as you'll understand - your half-decent shaman always knows where the nearest public bog is, and if it's worth legging it for the bus.</i></b>
