                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Into the forge's fiery glow I thrust the steel
And bend it into the arc of a wheel.
My hammer strikes; my muscles ache.
This is how I make what I make.

My dearest works with the stuff of dreams
Where nothing seen is what it seems.
Her image flickers, and people sigh.
How can she love my kind of guy?

Still she trembles when we kiss.
Is there hope for a match like this?</i></b>
