                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Do you take it I would astonish?
Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart
twittering through the woods?
Do I astonish more than they?

This hour I tell things in confidence,
I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.

(I am large, I contain multitudes)</i></b>
