                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We do have prayers, you know, Prayers for forgiveness,
daughters of mighty Zeus... and they limp and halt,
they're all wrinkled, drawn, they squint to the side, 
can't look you in the eyes, and always bent on duty,
trudging after Ruin, maddening, blinding Ruin. 
But Ruin is strong and swift --
She outstips them all by far, stealing a march,
leaping over the whole wide earth to bring mankind to grief.
And the Prayers trail after, trying to heal the wounds.</i></b>
