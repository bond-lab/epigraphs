                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Peace on Earth
 
 The Archer is wake! 
 The Swan is flying! 
 Gold against blue 
 An Arrow is lying. 
 There is hunting in heaven-- 
 Sleep safe till tomorrow.
 
 The Bears are abroad! 
 The Eagle is screaming! 
 Gold against blue 
 Their eyes are gleaming! 
 Sleep! 
 Sleep safe till tomorrow.
 
 The Sisters lie 
 With their arms intertwining; 
 Gold against blue 
 Their hair is shining! 
 The Serpent writhes! 
 Orion is listening! 
 Gold against blue 
 His sword is glistening! 
 Sleep! 
 There is hunting in heaven-- 
 Sleep safe till tomorrow.</i></b>
