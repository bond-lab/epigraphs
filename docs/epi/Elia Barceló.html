                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The squeezebox moans, the light's too bright;
night falls on the dance floor and pretty soon
the shadows are gathering, shades of 
Griseta, Malena and Mariester.
The shades the tango drew to the dance
make me recall her, too;
come on, let's dance, it hurts me so
to dream of her shining satin dress.

Whose ghost haunts the violin?
Whose sentimental voice,
tired of long suffering,
has started sobbing like this?
Perhaps it's her voice,
the voice that suddenly
fell silent one day.
Or perhaps it's my drink --
perhaps!
It can't be her voice,
her voice has passed on;
it must be nothing more
than the ghosts in my drink.

Like you, she was far away and pale;
her hair was dark, eyes olive grey.
And her mouth, by the early light of dawn,
was the sad hue of the rose.

One day she failed to show, I waited long,
and then they told me of her end.
That is why the shades of tangos
recall her to me again and again, in vain.</i></b>
