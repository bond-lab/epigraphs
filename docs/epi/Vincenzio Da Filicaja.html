                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>“See a fond mother encircled by her children: with pious tenderness she looks around, and her soul even melts with maternal love. One she kisses on the forehead, and clasps another to her bosom. One she sets upon her knee, and finds a seat upon her foot for another. And while, by their actions, their lisping words, and asking eyes, she understands their various, numberless little wishes, to these she dispenses a look; a word to those; but whether she smiles or frowns, ’tis all in tender love.”</i></b>
