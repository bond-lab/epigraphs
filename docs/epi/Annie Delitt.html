<li>IN: <i>White Nights in Split Town City</i> (2016) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I wonder, now, only when it will happen,
when the young mother will hear the 
noise like somebody's pressure cooker
down the block, going off. She'll go out into the yard
holding her small daughter in her arms,
and there, above the end of the street, in the 
air above the line of trees,
she will see it rising, lifting up
over our horizon, the upper rim of the 
gold ball, large as a giant
planet starting to lift up over ours.
She will be standing there in the yard holding her daughter,
looking at it rise and glow and blossom and rise,
and the child will open her arms to it,
it will look so beautiful.</i></b>
