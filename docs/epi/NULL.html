When he reported to the king what he had done, the king went to the blind men and asked them, "Tell me, blind men, what is an elephant like?"

Those who had been shown the tusk replied," An elephant is just like a plow pole." Those who had been shown the body replied, "An elephant is just like a storeroom."

chase,’ the grey wolf said. ‘Myself,’ said the tarantula, ‘I like to
sit here and wait for my prey to come to me.’ ‘Don’t you find
that lonely?’ the wolf asked. ‘I could as soon ask you,’ the tarantula
replied, ‘how it is that you don’t get sick of taking your wife
and kids along on every hunt.’ ‘I am by temperament a family
man,’ the wolf answered. ‘And what is more there is power in
numbers.’
The tarantula paused to crush a passing marmoset then said he
doubted the wolf, for all the help he received, would ever be as
successful a huntsman as he was. The wolf wagered a week’s catch
on his ability to outhunt the tarantula and, returning to his lair,
told his wife and children of the bet.
‘You owe me,’ he told the tarantula when they next met.
‘And your proof ?’
‘Well I expect you to trust my word, but if you don’t, then go
ahead and search the wilderness with your own eyes.’
This the tarantula did, and sure enough discovered that of all
the wolf ’s natural prey not a single creature remained.
‘I salute your efficiency,’ the tarantula said, ‘but it does occur
to me to wonder what you are going to do for sustenance now.’
At this the grey wolf burst into tears. ‘I have had to eat my
wife,’ he admitted. ‘And next week I will start on my children.’
‘And after that?’
‘After that? After that I will have no option but to eat myself.’

To a child who smiled to hear
This older man's employ.

Some fine and dashing boy.

There to sup the chalice, 
With one last tale to tell as time
Works my shape with malice;

Automated Alice.

To find a future clime; 
In which my Alice can escape
The radishes of time.

Turns to end this rhyme.</i></b>

n. The cleanly severed, pickled hand of a convicted, executed criminal, in particular a murderer. The pickling process varies from region to region, but most often involves brown vinegar, sesame seeds and zimort. It is common practice for the fingers to be fixed around a candle (made from the rendered fat of a dead man), but occasionally the index finger is threaded with a wick.Once alight the candle ensures that all sleeping members of a household remain in a state of lethargic somnolence, thus enabling the holder to burgle without fear of discovery. The candle can be quenched only by milk.</i></b>

1. A car manufactured by Pontiac. In this particular case, a car painted a color called Signet Gold and built in Lordstown, Ohio, in 1967. Almost sixteen feet long, with extremely poor gas mileage and no modern amenities. Has a cream-colored interior and a black convertible top and belches noxious clouds of instant-cancer fumes whenever started. Attracts an unreasonable amount of attention from car buffs (for its collectability) and others (because it's brightly colored, noisy, and as big as a battleship.)
2. A mythical creature prominently featured in Russian folktales. Possesses magical powers. Wherever the Firebird goes, princes, princesses, kings and mad wizards are sure to follow.
3. Presumably, any golden bird that's on fire.</i></b>

The Aztecs held the butterfly, papalotl, in high regard and had a special celebration to welcome the migrating monarchs in early August every year.

But the impack on the water supply -- and thus the growing season would be considerably higher.
Paradoxically, rapid climate change may bring much lower temperatures in many places. It should noted that some changes may well benefit people in the affected areas, at least temporarily, by extending growing seasons, negating weather extremes, or having some other unpredictable effect.
Unfortunately, the sensationalistic term, combined with the slow evolution of the effects prior to the crisis point, will make it hard to convince the general population of true danger.</i></b>

But Elric had not reckoned with a destiny already determining that he should learn and experience certain things which would have a profound effect upon him. Even before he encountered the blind captain and the Ship Which Sailed the Seas of Fate, he was to find his life, his soul and all his idealism in jeopardy.
In Ufych-Sormeer he was delayed over a matter involving a misunderstanding between four unworldly wizards who amiably and inadvertently threatened the destruction of the Young Kingdoms before they had served the Balance's ultimate purpose; and in Filkhar he experienced an affair of the heart which he would never again speak about; he was learning, at some cost, the power and the pain of bearing the Black Sword.
But it was in the desert city of Quarzhasaat that he began the adventure which was to help set the course of his weird for years to come. . .</i></b>

When I am gone you will inherit nothing but my bad name, this fur and this sword. Do not underestimate their power.

Do not think this an evil thing, for you will be lord and protector of many lands. While countless will die by your sword, countless others will live by it.
God rules this world and His people thrive, not because He is good but because He is strong. Christians once died like cattle, men, women and children hunted down and put to death in torturous ways. They only came to safety the day they struck back. At the battle of the Milvian Bridge, General Constantine destroyed the pagan horde of the pig Maxentius with blood and iron. This is the only lesson you need learn. The men of the One God rule because they are mightier than those of many gods. Do not be fooled by the wittering of priests and monks. Strength matters. Spare those who oppose you, and they will kill you and your children. This gift of rage I bequeath to you in the form of this sword, which has delivered death to more foes than I can count, and must continue to.
Worship God, serve your overlord, and vanquish your enemies — vanquish them utterly. There is no law but your own. God respects those who conquer and triumph in His name. Your enemies are His. Cleanse the world of them.</i></b>

and washes the years, the dust of the
many stories
from the High Tale of the Dragonlance.
For in ages deep, past memory and word,
in the first blush of the world
when the three moons rose from the
lap of the forest,
dragons, terrible and great,
made war on this world of Krynn.
Yet out of the darkness of dragons,
out of our cries for light
in the blank face of the black moon soaring,
a banked light flared in Solamnia,
a knight of truth and of power,
who called down the gods themselves
and forged the mighty Dragonlance,
piercing the soul
of dragonkind, driving the shade of
their wings
from the brightening shores of Krynn.
Thus Huma, Knight of Solamnia,
Lightbringer, First Lancer,
followed his light to the foot of the
Khalkist Mountains,
to the stone feet of the gods,
to the crouched silence of their temple.
He called down the Lancemakers, he took on
their unspeakable power to crush the
unspeakable evil,
to thrust the coiling darkness
back down the tunnel of the
dragon's throat.
Paladine, the Great God of Good,
shone at the side of Huma,
strengthening the lance of his strong right arm,
and Huma, ablaze in a thousand moons,
banished the Queen of Darkness,
banished the swarm of her shrieking hosts
back to the senseless kingdom of
death, where their curses
swooped upon nothing and nothing
deep below the brightening land.
Thus ended in thunder the Age of Dreams
and began the Age of Might,
When Istar, kingdom of light and
truth, arose in the east,
where minarets of white and gold
spired to the sun and to the sun's glory,
announcing the passing of evil,
and Istar, who mothered and cradled
the long summers of good,
shone like a meteor
in the white skies of the just.
Yet in the fullness of sunlight
the Kingpriest of Istar saw shadows:
At night he saw the trees as things
with daggers, the streams
blackened and thickened under the
silent moon.
He searched books for the paths of Huma,
for scrolls, signs, and spells
so that he, too, might summon the
gods, might find
their aid in his holy aims,
might purge the world of sin.
Then came the time of dark and death
as the gods turned from the world.
A mountain of fire crashed like a
comet through Istar,
the city split like a skull in the flames,
mountains burst from once-fertile valleys,
seas poured into the graves of mountains,
the deserts sighed on abandoned
floors of the seas,
the highways of Krynn erupted
and became the paths of the dead.
Thus began the Age of Despair.
The roads were tangled.
The winds and the sandstorms dwelt
in the husks of cities,
The plains and mountains became our home.
As the old gods lost their power,
we called to the blank sky
into the cold, dividing gray to the ears
of new gods.
The sky is calm, silent, unmoving.
We have yet to hear their answer.</i></b>

In the vanguard of winter, a dragon’s dance
Unraveled the land, until out of the forest,
Out of the plains they came, from the mothering earth,
The sky unreckoned before them.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
One from a garden of stone arising,
From dwarf—halls, from weather and wisdom,
Where the heart and mind tide unquestioned
In the untapped vein of the hand.
In his fathering arms, the spirit gathered.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
One from a haven of breezes descending,
Light in the handling air
To the waving meadows, the kender’s country,
Where the grain out of smallness arises itself
To grow green and golden and green again.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
The next from the plains, the long land’s keeping,
Nurtured in distance, horizons of nothing.
Bearing a staff she came, and a burden
Of mercy and light converged in her hand:
Beating the wounds of the world, she came.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
The next from the plains, in the moon’s shadow,
Through custom, through ritual, trailing the moon
Where her phases, her wax and her wane, controlled
The tide of his blood, and his warrior’s hand
Ascended through hierarchies of space into light.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
One within absences, known by departures,
The dark swordswoman at the heart of fire:
Her glories the space between words,
The cradlesong recollected in age,
Recalled at the edge of awakening and thought.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
One in the heart of honor, formed by the sword,
By the centuries’ flight of the kingfisher over the land,
By Solamnia ruined and risen, rising again
When the heart ascends into duty.
As it dances, the sword is forever an heirloom.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
The next in a simple light a brother to darkness,
Letting the sword hand try all subtleties,
Even the intricate webs of the heart. His thoughts
Are pools disrupted in changing wind
He cannot see their bottom.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
The next the leader, half—elven, betrayed
As the twining blood pulls asunder the land,
The forests, the worlds of elves and men.
Called into bravery, but fearing for love,
And fearing that, called into both, he does nothing.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
The last from the darkness, breathing the night
Where the abstract stars hide a nest of words,
Where the body endures the wound of numbers,
Surrendered to knowledge, until, unable to bless,
His blessing falls on the low, the benighted.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
Joined by others they were in the telling:
A graceless girl, graced beyond graces;
A princess of seeds and saplings, called to the forest;
An ancient weaver of accidents;
Nor can we say who the story will gather.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:
As the world declined, they arose
Into the heart of the story.
From the north came danger, as we knew it would:
In encampments of winter, the dragon’s sleep
Has settled the land, but out of the forest,
Out of the plain they come, from the mothering earth,
Defining the sky before them.
Nine they were, under the three moons,
Under the autumn twilight:

And since the Parapsychic Act was signed into Hegemony law, the psionic Talents have been harnessed to provide valuable service to mankind. Who can imagine a world without Skinlin and sedayeen cooperating to find new cures for every gene-morphing virus, creating new techniques for alteration and augmentation of the human body? Who can imagine a time when the Magi did not probe the laws of magick and alternate realities, or when Ceremonials and Shamans didn't minister to the needs of believers and track criminals, not to mention provide protection for houses and corporations? Who can imagine a world without psions? The Necromance's place within this continuum is assured: The Necromance treads in that realm of mystery called Death. At hospital bedsides and in courtrooms, Necromances ease the passing of their fellow humans or provide testimony for the last wishes of the dead. An accredited Necromance's work touches the very mundane world of finance, wills, and bequests at the same time that they peer into the dry land of Death and return with absolute proof that there is an afterlife. Necromances also work in the Criminal Justice arm of the Hegemony, tracking criminals and murderers. A Necromance requires not only the talent for entering the realm of Death, but also the training and sorcerous Will to come back out of Death. This is why accreditation of Necromances is so expensive, and so harrowing for even the Academy-trained psionics whose Talent lies in Necromance.
On the flap opposite you will see several careers where an accredited Necromance can make a difference…</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>The Devil's Right Hand</i> (2007) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The last of the theories is the most intriguing: what if the Awakening itself was prompted by a collective evolution of the human race? Psionic talent before the Awakening was notoriously unreliable. The Parapsychic Act, by codifying and making it possible to train psionic ability, cannot alone account for the flowering of Talent and magickal ability just prior to its signing into law—no matter how loudly apologists for Adrien Ferrimen cry.
A corollary to the theory of collective evolution is the persistent notion that another intelligence was responsible. The old saw about demonic meddling with the human genetic code has surfaced in this debate so many times as to be a cliché. But as any Magi will tell you, demonkind’s fascination with humans cannot be explained unless they somehow had a hand in our evolution, as they themselves claim.
For if there is one law in dealing with demons, it is their possessive nature. A demon will destroy a beloved object rather than allow its escape; in this they are like humanity. A second law is just as important in dealing with demons: as with loa or etrigandi, their idea of truth is not at all the human legal definition. A demon’s idea of a truth might be whatever serves the purpose of a moment or achieves a particular end. This leads to the popular joke that lawyers make good Magi, which this author can believe.
In fact, one might say that in jealousy and falsity either we learned from demonkind, or they caught these tendencies like a sickness from us—and the latter option is not at all likely, given how much older a race they are…</i></b>

ESKIMO VILLAGE VANISHES!
RCMP Confirms Trapper’s Story
Special to the Star,
Lake Territory, November 23. The inspector for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police returned today to confirm the disappearance of an Eskimo village in the Northern Lakes region. Ten days ago, fur trapper Joe LaBelle contacted the RCMP to report a chilling discovery. While running a trapline, LaBelle snowshoed out to an isolated Eskimo village on the shores of Lake Anjikuni only to discover every inhabitant — man, woman, and child — had vanished from their huts and storehouses. “It was as if every one of them poor folk up and took off with no more than the shirts on their backs.”
Inspector Pierre Menard of the RCMP returned with his team’s findings today and confirmed the trapper’s story. The village had indeed been found abandoned under most strange circumstances. “In our search, we discovered undisturbed foodstuff, gear, and provisions but no sign of the villagers. Not a single footprint or track.” Even the Eskimos’ sled dogs were found buried under the snow, starved to death. But the most disturbing discovery of all was reported at the end: the Eskimos’ ancestral graves were found excavated and emptied.
The RCMP promises to continue the search, but for now the fate of the villagers remains a mystery.</i></b>

An unprotected human on the surface of Mars would very likely freeze within minutes, but first would die of exposure to the near-vacuum. If this unfortunate human survived freezing and low pressure, and found a supply of oxygen to breathe, she would still be endangered by high levels of radiation from the sun and elsewhere.
After Earth, Mars is the most hospitable planet in the Solar System.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>LATELY MUCH HAS BEEN MADE of Dr. Eugene Bryce and his study of the so-called “brilliants,” that percentage of children born since 1980 with exceptional abilities. While the full scope of their gifts is unknown, it’s clear that something remarkable has happened: savants are being born not once in a generation, but every hour of every day.
Historically, the term “savant” was generally paired with another word, to form an unkind but not inaccurate phrase: idiot savant. Those rare individuals with superhuman gifts were generally crippled in some way. Broken geniuses, they were able to recreate the London skyline after only a moment’s glance, yet unable to order a cup of tea; able to intuit string theory or noncommutative geometry and yet be baffled by their mother’s smile. It was as though evolution was maintaining equilibrium, giving here, taking there.
However, this is not the case with the “brilliants.” Dr. Bryce estimates that as many as one in a hundred children born since 1980 have these advantages, and that these children are otherwise statistically normal. They are smart, or not. Social, or not. Talented, or not. In other words, apart from their wondrous gifts, they are exactly as children have been since the dawn of man.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, public discussion has focused on cause. Where did these children come from? Why now? Will this continue on forever, or will it end as abruptly as it began?
But there’s a more important issue. A question with shattering implications. A question that is on the tip of our collective tongues, and yet that we do not discuss—perhaps because we fear the answer.
What will happen when these children grow up?</i></b>

The mountains form the water-parting in the landscape between the Hudson and the St. Lawrence Rivers. The region was once covered by the Lawrentian glacier, whose gradual but powerful erosion produced the characteristic features of the area: scores of lakes and ponds, and many picturesque falls and rapids in the streams. It is a region rich in waterways...
As well as scenic appeal, the region is known for its rich and various flora and fauna. Much of the area has been preserved... over 3,000,000 acres have been set aside to form the Adirondack Park... the wildlife within the region is extraordinarily vigorous and multitudinous. The region is heavily forested with spruce, pine and broad-leaved trees. The mountain peaks are usually rounded, and easily scaled. The vistas thus achieved, of mountain, lake and plateau and forest, are almost unequalled in any other part of the United States for scenic grandeur.</i></b>

It was a quixotic idea that seemed to gain no traction: there was no ad campaign outside of a few media outlets in a few major cities, and not much press coverage even in those markets. But something surprising was happening under the radar …
Invited as a special guest to a local meeting, I arrived with limited expectations. What I would find, I suspected, was a group of perfectly ordinary people who had been convinced to pay annual dues for the privilege of flattering one another, a commercial conceit of which P. T. Barnum might have been proud. But there was a real energy in the gathering—social, sexual, intellectual—that took me by surprise. It made me wonder where all this was going, and I asked one young woman what she thought the members of her Affinity might be doing in twenty or thirty years.
She laughed at the question. “Writing our memoirs, I guess,” she said. “Or maybe signing our confessions.”</i></b>

Founded by Bd. Marie-Ange de Berville in 1895, the Nursing Sisters of the Blood of Christ are dedicated to giving succor and providing healing to the innocent victims of war and oppression. The order, which was one of the few to retain the habit after the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, is noted for its almost military discipline and its custom of recruiting very young girls from the ranks of abandoned and disabled children throughout the world, although this aspect of its work has been widely criticized. Sisters of the order have distinguished themselves by their bravery and self-sacrifice during both world wars and thereafter in many fields of strife. Although counting no more than three thousand professed sisters and oblates at the present time, it has lost to death over 120 of its number, more than any other order in modern times. Traditionally, its members categorically refuse to leave patients and communities for which they have taken responsibility, in keeping with the order’s motto “Where we go, we remain.”See also Bd.

But the impact on the water supply—and thus the growing season—would be considerably higher.
 Paradoxically, rapid climate change may bring much lower temperatures in many places. It should be noted that some changes may well benefit people in the affected areas, at least temporarily, by extending growing seasons, negating weather extremes, or having some other unpredictable effect.
 Unfortunately, the sensationalistic term, combined with the slow evolution of the effects prior to the crisis point, will make it hard to convince the general population of the true danger.</i></b>

     For, looking back when years shall flow
     Upon this olden day that's now,
     We'll see, romantic in dimm'd hours,
     These memories of ours.</i></b>

Oh hand it over, oh hand it over, and your life I’ll spare”

Young Sophie and her true love were seen
He spied his watch hanging from her clothes
Which made him blush lads, which made him blush lads like any rose

“Why do you blush you silly thing
I thought to have that diamond ring
T’was I who robbed you all on the plain
So here’s your gold, love, so here’s your gold and your watch and chain

I only did it for to know

If you had given me that ring she said

Interpandemic Period
Phase 1. No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. An influenza virus subtype that has caused human infection may be present in animals. If present in animals, the risk of human infection or disease is considered to be low.

Phase 2. No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. However, a circulating animal influenza virus subtype poses a substantial risk of human disease.

Pandemic Alert Period
Phase 3. Human infection(s) with a new subtype but no human-to-human spread or at most rare instances of spread to a close contact.

Phase 4. Small cluster(s) with limited human-to-human spread is highly localized, suggesting that the virus is not well adapted to humans

Phase 5. Larger cluster(s) but human-to-human spread is still localized, suggesting that the virus is becoming increasingly better adapted to humans but may not yet be fully transmissible (substantial pandemic risk).

Pandemic Period
Phase 6. Pandemic phase: increased and sustained transmission in the general population.

The long buildings of the projects here are arranged in jagged rows, with empty cement squares between them— the intended playgrounds for the young Combers. The teeth of the comb are white. They stare with many eyes and they all look just the same. In places where they haven’t sprouted yet, there are the fenced vacant lots. The piles of debris from the houses already knocked down, nesting grounds for rats and stray dogs, are much more appealing to the young Combers than the empty spaces between the teeth.

In the no-man’s- land between the two worlds— that of the the teeth and that of the dumps— is the House. They call it Gray House. It is old, closer in age to the dumps, the graveyards of its contemporaries. It stands alone, as the other houses shun it, and it doesn’t look like a tooth, since it is not struggling upward. Three stories high, facing the highway, it too has a backyard— a narrow rectangle cordoned off by chicken wire. It was white when built. It has since become gray, and yellowish from the other side, toward the back. It is bristling with aerials; it is strewn with cables; it is raining down plaster and weeping from the cracks. Additions and sheds cling to it, along with doghouses and garbage bins, all in the back. The facade is bare and somber, just the way it is supposed to be.

Nobody likes Gray House. No one would admit it openly, but the inhabitants of the Comb would rather not have it in their neighborhood. They would rather it didn’t exist at all.~~</i></b>

Many months passed before anyone died. When, in the end, a neighbor's child did die, Leeyio was summoned to dispose of the body. When he took the corpse outside, he made a mistake and said, "Moon die and come back again, man die and remain away." So after that, no man survived death.
A few more months elapsed, and Leeyio's own child died. So the father took the corpse outside and said, "Moon die and remain away, man die and come back again." On hearing this, Naiteru-kop said to Leeyio, "You were too late now, for through your own mistake, death was born the day when your neighbor's child died." So that is how death came about, and that is why up to this day, when a man dies, he does not return, but when the moon dies, it always comes back again."`</i></b>

After World War II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that, while ensuring China's soverignity, imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people...
Following the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million Nationalists under CHIANG KAI-SHEK fled to Taiwan. Over the next five decades, the ruling authorities gradually democratized. In 2000, Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT) to the Democratic Progressive Party. 
The dominant political issue for both countries continues to be the question of eventual unification.</i></b>

Officers arrived on the scene around 2 a.m. in response to a 911 call reporting several gunshots. The victim, Steve Yoon, defected from North Korea and was granted asylum two years ago. According to reports, he was the head of Friends of Freedom, a human rights organization.
Sources said that the victim's face had been wiped with antiseptic. Mysterious numbers and pictures were scrawled in blood around the body. Officials arrested an unidentified man at the scene. According to hospital sources, the suspect is in stable condition after being treated for a bullet wound to the thigh. Antiseptic and the victim's blood were detected on his hands, sources said.
Officials are focusing on the victim's past employment at major North Korean government facilities. Upon arriving in the U. S. Yoon provided information about the secluded country's nuclear program. A police official said, "We aren't sure if this is a straightforward murder or something more. We are considering every possibility, including an act of retribution by North Korea to punish the information leak.</i></b>

From the simple, fresh style of early songs such as "I Want to Hold Your Hand" (1962), the Beatles progressed to innovative, experimental works such as the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), admired for its dramatic unity, haunting harmony and lyrics, asymmetrical musical phrases and rhythms, and integrated use of electronic music techniques and Indian sitar sound.

Some powers left alone.

Ours is a story of greed and destruction, of a people not ready for the treasure they guarded. Our end came not from the stars but from within, from war and chaos. We were not, and never had been, worthy of what had been given to us. 

Within the mathematical cipher of this message lies a key to build a door into the aether. Beyond the door, beyond the aether, you will face your trial. The worthy, the chosen, will find the power we died to protect, and rise into the stars. 

Know that the journey is unending. Know that the dangers ahead will be many. Know that unlocking the door may lead to salvation or doom. So choose. Choose the stars or the void; choose hope or despair; choose light or the undying dark of space.

  An ebbing tide like this. These swirls denote
  How wind and tide conspire. I can but float
To the open sea and strike no more for land.
Farewell, brown cliffs, farewell, beloved sand
  Her feet have pressed—farewell, dear little boat
  Where Gelert,[Footnote] calmly sitting on my coat,
Unconscious of my peril, gazes bland!
All dangers grip me save the deadliest, fear:
  Yet these air-pictures of the past that glide—
  These death-mirages o'er the heaving tide—
Showing two lovers in an alcove clear,
  Will break my heart. I see them and I hear
As there they sit at morning, side by side.
[Footnote: A famous swimming dog.]

THE VISION
_With Barton elms behind—in front the sea,
  Sitting in rosy light in that alcove,
They hear the first lark rise o'er Raxton Grove:
'What should I do with fame, dear heart?' says he,
'You talk of fame, poetic fame, to me
  Whose crown is not of laurel but of love—
  To me who would not give this little glove
On this dear hand for Shakespeare's dower in fee.
While, rising red and kindling every billow,
  The sun's shield shines 'neath many a golden spear,
To lean with you, against this leafy pillow,
  To murmur words of love in this loved ear—
To feel you bending like a bending willow,
  This is to be a poet—this, my dear!'_
O God, to die and leave her—die and leave
  The heaven so lately won!—And then, to know
  What misery will be hers—what lonely woe!—
To see the bright eyes weep, to see her grieve
Will make me a coward as I sink, and cleave
  To life though Destiny has bid me go.
  How shall I bear the pictures that will glow
Above the glowing billows as they heave?
One picture fades, and now above the spray
  Another shines: ah, do I know the bowers
  Where yon sweet woman stands—the woodland flowers,
In that bright wreath of grass and new-mown hay—
  That birthday wreath I wove when earthly hours
Wore angel-wings,—till portents brought dismay?
Shall I turn coward here who sailed with Death
  Through many a tempest on mine own North Sea,
  And quail like him of old who bowed the knee—
Faithless—to billows of Genesereth?
Did I turn coward when my very breath
  Froze on my lips that Alpine night when He
  Stood glimmering there, the Skeleton, with me,
While avalanches rolled from peaks beneath?
Each billow bears me nearer to the verge
  Of realms where she is not—where love must wait.
If Gelert, there, could hear, no need to urge
  That friend, so faithful, true, affectionate,
  To come and help me, or to share my fate.
Ah! surely I see him springing through the surge.
       [The dog, plunging into the tide and striking
            towards his master with immense strength,
            reaches him and swims round him.]
Oh, Gelert, strong of wind and strong of paw,
  Here gazing like your namesake, 'Snowdon's Hound,'
  When great Llewelyn's child could not be found,
And all the warriors stood in speechless awe—
Mute as your namesake when his master saw
  The cradle tossed—the rushes red around—
  With never a word, but only a whimpering sound
To tell what meant the blood on lip and jaw!
In such a strait, to aid this gaze so fond,
  Should I, brave friend, have needed other speech
Than this dear whimper? Is there not a bond
  Stronger than words that binds us each to each?—
But Death has caught us both. 'Tis far beyond
  The strength of man or dog to win the beach.
Through tangle-weed—through coils of slippery kelp
  Decking your shaggy forehead, those brave eyes
  Shine true—shine deep of love's divine surmise
As hers who gave you—then a Titan whelp!—
I think you know my danger and would help!—
  See how I point to yonder smack that lies
  At anchor—Go! His countenance replies.
Hope's music rings in Gelert's eager yelp!
             [The dog swims swiftly away down the tide.]
Now, life and love and death swim out with him!
  If he should reach the smack, the men will guess
  The dog has left his master in distress.
She taught him in these very waves to swim—
'The prince of pups,' she said, 'for wind and limb'—
  And now those lessons come to save—to bless.
ENVOY
(The day after the rescue: Gelert and his master walking along the sand.)

'Twas in no glittering tourney's mimic strife,—
  'Twas in that bloody fight in Raxton Grove,
  While hungry ravens croaked from boughs above,
And frightened blackbirds shrilled the warning fife—
'Twas there, in days when Friendship still was rife.
  Mine ancestor who threw the challenge-glove
  Conquered and found his foe a soul to love,
Found friendship—Life's great second crown of life.
So I this morning love our North Sea more
  Because he fought me well, because these waves
Now weaving sunbows for us by the shore
  Strove with me, tossed me in those emerald caves
  That yawned above my head like conscious graves—
I love him as I never loved before.</i></b>

     Beneath green boughs, which faded long ago,
Made merry in the golden summer weather,
     Pelted each other with new-fallen snow.

Did the sun always shine? I can't remember
     A single cloud that dimmed the happy blue,—
A single lightning-bolt or peal of thunder,
     To daunt our bright, unfearing lives: can you?

We quarrelled often, but made peace as quickly,
     Shed many tears, but laughed the while they fell,
Had our small woes, our childish bumps and bruises,
     But Mother always "kissed and made them well."

Is it long since?—it seems a moment only:
     Yet here we are in bonnets and tail-coats,
Grave men of business, members of committees,
     Our play-time ended: even Baby votes!

And star-eyed children, in whose innocent faces
     Kindles the gladness which was once our own,
Crowd round our knees, with sweet and coaxing voices,
     Asking for stories of that old-time home.

"Were you once little too?" they say, astonished;
     "Did you too play? How funny! tell us how."
Almost we start, forgetful for a moment;
     Almost we answer, "We are little now! "

Dear friend and lover, whom to-day we christen,
     Forgive such brief bewilderment,—thy true
And kindly hand we hold; we own thee fairest.
     But ah! our yesterday was precious too.

So, darlings, take this little childish story,
     In which some gleams of the old sunshine play,
And, as with careless hands you turn the pages,
     Look back and smile, as here I smile to-day.</i></b>

By the brown Assiniboine, 
And a turnin' prairie gumbo 
Into heaps of shining coin. 
In the foothills of the Rockies

And that's why in old Toronto 
I'm a-pinin' for the West. 
Where the sparkling sunbeams glance 
All across the wide expanse 
And the ozone in the breezes
Makes your pulse throb and dance. 

On the road to Rupert's Land 
Are the boys that understand. 
For in spring their feet are turning 
To that free and fertile land. 

I can see the smacks a-fishing 
On Lake Winnipeg so wide, 
And the lumber steamers loading 
By the humming sawmill's side. 
I can see the silent redmen 
As they row the livelong day
In the big fur-laden York boats 
On the road to Hudson Bay. 
And the lonely miners stand 
To wash out the golden sand 
And the summer throw her lilies 
Like a garment o'er the land. 

On the road to Rupert's Land 
Are the girls that understand, 
For when nations are a-building 
You will find them close at hand. 

Put me somewhere west of Selkirk
When the prairie roses bloom, 
Where you run clean out o' fences. 
And a man has elbow room. 
Let me ride upon the pilot 
When the first through train goes out, 
Let me hear the settlers welcome it 
With joyous ringing shout. 
Let me be upon the prairie
When they start a baby town, 
When they're living under canvas
While the first mud-sills go down ; 
For it rarely stirs the bloos 
To see the cities in the bud 
And to feel a nation growing 
From that sticky prairie mud. 

On the road to Rupert's Land 
You will find a mighty band, 
For they're going West by thousands 
Now they've come to understand.</i></b>
