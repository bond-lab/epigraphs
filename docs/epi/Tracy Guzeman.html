<li>IN: <i>The Gravity of Birds</i> (2013) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I wake earlier, now that the birds have come
And sing in the unfailing trees. 
On a cot by an open window
I lie like land used up, while spring unfolds.

Now of all voyagers I remember, who among them
Did not board ship with grief among their maps?â€” 
Till it seemed men never go somewhere, they only leave
Wherever they are, when the dying begins.

For myself, I find my wanting life
Implores no novelty and no disguise of distance; 
Where, in what country, might I put down these thoughts, 
Who still am citizen of this fallen city?

On a cot by an open window, I lie and remember
While the birds in the trees sing of the circle of time. 
Let the dying go on, and let me, if I can, 
Inherit from disaster before I move. 

O, I go to see the great ships ride from harbor, 
And my wounds leap with impatience; yet I turn back
To sort the weeping ruins of my house: 
Here or nowhere I will make peace with the fact.
