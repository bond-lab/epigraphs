                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>What does it mean to love somebody? It is always to seize that person in a mass, extract him or her from a group, however small, in which he or she participates, whether it be through the family only or through something else; then to find that person's own {wolf} packs, the multiplicities he or she encloses within himself or herself which may be of an entirely different nature.</i></b>
