But cherishing your friendship's claim,
I would have wished a finer treasure
To pledge my token to your name --
One worthy of your soul's perfection,
The sacred dreams that fill your your gaze,
Your verse's limpid, live complexion,
Your noble thoughts and simple ways.
But let it be. Take this collection
Of sundry chapters as my suit:
Half humorous, half pessimistic,
Blending the plain and idealistic --
Amusement's yield, the careless fruit
Of sleepless nights, light inspirations,
Born of my green and withered years....
The intellect's cold observations,
The heart's reflections, writ in tears.</i></b>

Standing all alone.

Snow falls thick and heavy;
A black raven, a whistling wing,
Hovers above the sledge;
Its prophetic cry gives voice to sorrow!
The steeds go dashing on
Peering into the darkling distance;
Their manes fly in the wind...</i></b>
