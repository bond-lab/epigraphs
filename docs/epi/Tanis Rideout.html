                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There have been joys too great to be described in words, and there have been griefs upon which I have not dared to dwell; and with these in mind I say, Climb if you will, but remember that courage and strength are nought without prudence, and that a momentary negligence may destroy the happiness of a lifetime. Do nothing in haste; look well with each step; and from the beginning think what may be the end.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Upward I looked, and beheld its shoulders, 
Vested already with that planet's rays
Which leadeth others right by every road.
Then was my fear a little quieted.</i></b>
