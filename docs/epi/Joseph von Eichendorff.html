                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In a cool and airy mead
There turns the wind a wheel; 
My beloved she did leave,
Who lived there in that field.

She pledged her love forever
Gave me a ring therewith;
She broke her pledge asunder, 
My ring did split in half. 

When I hear that wheel still turn,
I don't know what to do,
Death is that for which I yearn,
Then quiet would it be too.</i></b>
