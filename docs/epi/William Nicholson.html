                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Desdemona: Dost thou in conscience think -- tell me, 
Emilia -- 
That there be women do abuse their husbands 
In such gross knd?
Emilia: There be some such, no question.
Desdemona: Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? 
Emilia: Why, would not you?
Desdemona: No, by this heavenly light!
Emilia: Nor I neither, by this heavenly light; 
I might do't as well i'the dark.
..Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour, 
As husbands have. What is it that they do
When they change us for others? Is it sport?
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too: and have not we affections,
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Why I chose the name is not clear, but I know what thoughts were in my mind. There is a poem of John Donne, written just before his death, which I know and love. From it a quotation:
'As East and West
In all flat maps -- and I am one -- are one,
So death doth touch the resurrection.'
That still does not make a Trinity, but in another better known devotional poem Donne opens, 'Batter my heart, 
three-person'd God...'</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Batter my heart, three-person'd God; for you
As yet but knock...
Yet dearly I love you, and would be loved fain,
But am betrothed unto your enemy;
Divorce me, untie me, or break that knot again,
Take me to you, imprison me, for I,
Except you enthral me, never shall be free,
Not ever chaste, except you ravish me.</i></b>
