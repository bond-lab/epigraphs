                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I did not know then how much was ended. When I look back now... I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud, and was buried in the blizzard. A people's dream died there. It was a beautiful draem... the nation's hoop is broken and scattered. There is no center any longer, and the sacred tree is dead.</i></b>
