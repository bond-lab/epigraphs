                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Through some connection, without opening your eyes / You've seen in your mother's womb, as you see in your dream / How birds dart in the air, how Adam is the earth // From which he sprang to sing it / How Moses came to rid Egypt of its plagues / How a fragile vessel contains sweet wine // So the eyes receive what's invisible / and a mixture of one hazy substance with the other / is the great secret of love</i></b>
