                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Why do we search so diligently for sorcerers? Hear me, you judges, and I will show you where they are. Rise, attack the Capuchins, Jesuits, and all the members of holy orders. Attack them, they will confess. If any deny, torture them three times, four times, and they’ll confess. […] If you want more, attack the prelates, canons, theologians and they, too, will confess. How can these delicate, gentle men endure something like that?</i></b>
