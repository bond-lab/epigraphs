                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Specific events in Asian history of the twentieth century have acquired important visibility in the American collective consciousness... the number of biographical, autobiographical, and fictional texts and movies on these events has heightened their prominence on the American scene, leading us, once more, to appreciate the cultural work they enact in the process of raising awareness of history and inviting comprehension towards the persons who have become dislocated as a result of that history.</i></b>
