                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>On and on the Great River rolls, racing east.
Of proud and gallant heroes its white-tops leave no trace,
As right and wrong, pride and fall turn all at once unreal.
Yet ever the green hills stay
To blaze in the west-wanting day.

Fishers and woodsmen comb the river isles.
White-crowned, they've seen enough of spring and autumn
To make good company over the wine jar,
Where many a famed event
Provides their merriment.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Ershiwu shi tanci</i>,  (None), Poem, China
