                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The order strikes like lightning.
"Get that one, he's still breathing!"
He hears three explosions at point-blank range. At the first one, a cloud of dust shoots up by his head. Then he feels a searing pain in his face and his mouth fills with blood. The guards don't bend down to see if he's dead. Seeing his face split open and bloody is enough for them. And so they walk off, believing they've given him the coup de grace.</i></b>
