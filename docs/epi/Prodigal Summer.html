                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Come, all you who are not satisfied / a ruler in a lone, wallpapered room / full of mute birds, and flowers that falsely bloom, / and closets choked with dreams that long ago died! // Come, let us sweep the old streets--like a bride: / sweep out dead leaves with a relentless broom; / prepare for Spring, as though he were our groom / for whose light footstep eagerly we bide. // We'll sweep out shadows, where the rats long fed; sweep out our shame--and in its place we'll make a bower for love, a splendid marriage-bed / fragrant with flowers aquiver for the Spring. And when he comes, our murdered dreams shall wake; / and when he comes, all the mute birds shall sing.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Prothalamium</i>,  (1948), Poem, US
