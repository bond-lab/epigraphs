                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the County Kildare the circumstances and appearance of the population located on the bogs, or in their immediate viccinity, are very favourable. On each side of those parts of the canal that pass through the the bog, the land is let in small lots to turf-cutters who take up their residence on the spot, however dreary and uncomfortable. Their first care is to excavate a site fit for habitation on the driest bank that can be selected, which is sunk so deep that little more than the roof is visible; this is covered with scanty thatch, or more frequently with turf pared from the bog, laid down with the herbage upward, which is superficially assimilated with the aspect of the surrounding scenery that the eye would pass it over unnoticed, were it not undeceived by the appearance of the children and domestic animals sallying from a hole in one side, and by the occasional gush of smoke from the numerous chinks in the roof. The English language is everywhere spoken.</i></b>
