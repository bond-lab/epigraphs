We may remember how, in childhood, adults were able at first to look right through us, and into us, and what an acomplishment it was when we, in fear and trembling, could tell our first lie, and make, for ourselves, the discovery that we are irredeemably alone in certain respects, and know that within the territory of ourselves, there can only be our own footprints.</i></b>
