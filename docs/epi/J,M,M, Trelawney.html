                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Notwithstanding the modern emphasis on sport techniques, whose proper province is the competitive mat, the age-old street deciders of the kick to the groin, the eye-gouge, and the head butt, remain the staples of any system of self-defence worth of the name. WIth these techniques the weak may realistically hope to overcome the strong. In general, most systems of unarmed combat actually follow the principles of an asymmetrical military strategy: as in guerilla warfare, the weak, the elderly, the diminutive, or the outnumbered may select a target and, through applying all their force to a sequestered part of the opponents anatomy, by instrumentality of the heel hook, the arm-bar, small-joint manipulation, or the triangle choke, actually prove themselves stronger than the foe - at that moment in time and at that point d'appui.</i></b>
