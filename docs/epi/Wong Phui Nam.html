                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The legend the dead bear in the shifting rain/ extends the habitations of a private landscape / which in the light of morning, / upon a fallen hill-side and mud about / the hedges in a suburb that few ever think upon, / will bring no change of heart / or hints for our new roof-lines.</i></b>
