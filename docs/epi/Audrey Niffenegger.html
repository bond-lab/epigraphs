<li>IN: <i>The Time Traveler’s Wife</i> (2003) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The time will come 
when, with elation, 
you will greet yourself arriving 
at your own door, in your own mirror, 
and each will smile at the other’s welcome,
and say, sit here. Eat. 
You will love again the stranger who was your self. 
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart 
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you

all your life, whom you ignored 
for another, who knows you by heart. 
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,

the photographs, the desperate notes 
peel your own image from the mirror. 
Sit. Feast on your life. </i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>"Love After Love"</i>,  (1976), Poem, Saint Lucia
