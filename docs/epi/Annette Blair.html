                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A roman legion, Killian, the dark witch did change into dragons and banish.
To the Island of Stars on a plane beyond ours, they did vanish. Wondrous beasts who might well be dead,
Wondrous beasts who might well be dead,
But for Andra, guardian witch, from whom hope never fled.
At the rise of the moons when all went black
She had turned the first to a man with mild flak
So for this and future spells, her rhyme stayed intact:
Shed horns, spines, claws and webbed wings. Shrink scales, spade and tail--
Killian countered with a fiery bolt; Darkwyn writhed as he took the jolt
While Andra missed not a beat or a mote:
Warrior to beast, now back again. Send this man to the pane he began.
Darkwyn twisted to shift from dragon to man, in the steam of the rift
And elder stood by to share the gift.</i></b>
