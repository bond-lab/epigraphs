                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The brain is wider than the sky, / For, put them side by side, / The one the other will contain / With ease, and you beside. / The brain is deeper than the sea, / For, hold them, blue to blue, / The one the other will absorb, / As sponges, buckets do. / The brain is just the weight of God,/ For, heft them, pound for pound, / And they will differ, if they do, / As syllable from sound</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The greatest delight which the fields and woods minister, is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them. The waving of the boughs in the storm, is new to me and old. It takes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown. Its effect is like that of a higher thought or a better emotion coming over me, when I deemed I was thinking justly or doing right.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Earth may be alive: not as the ancients saw her -- a sentient Goddess with a purpose and foresight -- but alive like a tree. A tree that quietly exists, never moving except to sway in the wind, yet endlessly conversing with the sunlight and the soil. Using sunlight and water and nutrient minerals to grow and change. But all done so imperceptibly, that to me the old oak tree on the green is the same as it was when I was a child.</i></b>
