                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Power-including the capacity to shape the very categories used to classify for admission and to designate specific groups as warranting special consideration... is at the center of this process. From this perspective, an admissions policy is a kind of negotiated settlement among contending groups, each wishing to shape admissions criteria and the actual selection process to produce the outcome they prefer.</i></b>
