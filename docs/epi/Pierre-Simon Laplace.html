                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>If an intelligence, at a given instant, knew all the forces that animate nature and the position of each constituent being, if moreover, this intelligence were sufficiently great to submit these data to analysis, it could embrace in the same formula the movements of the greatest bodies in the universe and those of the smallest atoms: to this intelligence nothing would be uncertain, and the future, as the past, would be present to its eyes.</i></b>
