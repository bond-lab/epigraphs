                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>People that build their houses inland, 
People that buy a plot of ground
Shaped like a house, and build a house there, 
Far from the sea-board, far from the sound 

Of water sucking the hollow ledges, 
Tons of water striking the shore -- 
What do they long for, as I long for 
One salt smell of the sea once more? 

People the waves have not awakened, 
Spanking the boats at the harbour's head, 
What do they long for, as I long for, --
Starting up in my inland bed, 

Beating the narrow walls, and finding 
Neither a window nor a door, 
Screaming to God for death by drowning -- 
One salt taste of the sea once more?</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Inland</i>,  (1921), Poem, US
