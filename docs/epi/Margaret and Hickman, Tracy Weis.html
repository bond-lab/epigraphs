                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Three were the thoughts of those in Thorbardin
In the dark after Dergoth when the ogres danced.
One was the lost light, the limping darkness
In the caves of the kingdom where light crumbles.
One the despair of the Dwarfthane Derkin
Gone to the gloom of the tower of Glory.
One the world, weary and wounded
Down to the deep of the Darkling’s waters.
Under the heart of the highland,
Under the ceiling of stone,
Under the wane of the world’s glory.
Home under home.
Then was Kharas among us, the Keeper of Kings.
The Hand on the Hammer, Arm of the Hylar.
At the gleaming gravesite of gold and garnet
Three sons of the thane he buried thereunder.
While Derkin saw dark upon dark in the tunnels,
In the halls of the nation saw nooses and knives,
killers and kingmakers came to Kharas
With agate and amethyst, asking allegiance.
Under the heart of the highland,
Under the ceiling of stone,
Under the wane of the world’s glory.
Home under home.
But the stalwart in heart is strong as a stone.
And bold and unbending his mind to the better:
The Hammer of Hylar was firm in the halls,
Denying all discord, all doubt and division,
He turned from intrigue, from the wild tunnels,
Out to the open, one oath swearing
That time not treachery shall ever tarnish
The Hammer’s return in a time of great troubles.
Under the heart of the highland,
Under the ceiling of stone,
Under the wane of the world’s glory.
Home under home.</i></b>
