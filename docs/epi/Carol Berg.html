                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Keep me from going to sleep too soon
Or if I go to sleep too soon
Come wake me up. Come any hour
Of night. Come whistling up the road.
Stomp on the porch. Bang on the door.
Make me get out of bed and come
And let you in and light a light.
Tell me the northern lights are on
And make me look. Or tell me clouds
Are doing something to the moon
They never did before, and show me.
See that I see. Talk to me till
I'm half as wide awake as you
And start to dress wondering why
I ever went to bed at all.
Tell me the walking is superb.
Not only tell me but persuade me.
You know I'm not too hard persuaded.

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The blades of winter pierce root and stone, dust and light. Day sky sheened with silver; stars shattered with frost; life burrowed deep. The killing season. A fragile beauty, fraught with danger, hunger, and pain. Stripped branch and barren vine crack and shrivel. My heart yearns for warmth, for companionship, for glory. Yet waking is storm. 'Tis harsh magic to dance on ice.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The teeth of spring bite sea and stone. Storm and mist shadow the cove. The glade starves. Where is the fire? Where is the heart? Where is the gladness of the season, when danger lurks amid trees yet barren, and in the sea yet cold and dark? Dance, my brother. Spin, my sister. For root and sap, for wave and worm. Call glory to banish grief too long lingered.</i></b>
