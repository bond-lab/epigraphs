                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>If you are involved in a fantasy relationship with someone in which the sex is so good it’s like a fantasy and things happen between you that are incredibly private and unmentionable that you could never do with anyone else ever again so much so that you moan with pleasure in bed and can’t believe it’s really happening and don’t even bother fantasizing about anyone else or any situation other than the one you’re in, then you are in very very serious trouble and good luck to you. It won’t last and when it ends, you’ll walk the floor and wear out your shoes.

If, on the other hand, you are involved with someone with whom you have regular, decent sex that feels good and normal, but that you would never think about for a moment when masturbating— which is by no means to put it down— then the chances of this relationship lasting a very long time, of the two of you growing old together, are very good. But often this is simply not enough. Or is it enough when what is wanted, unfortunately or not, is more than enough.</i></b>
