                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A rumor was prevalent in Burke County that Silver wrote some verses which were tantamount to a confession of her guilt and read them while on the scaffold to the surrounding throng just before she was executed.
The mind of Squire Waits A. Cook, a highly respected justice of the peace in the Enola section, was a veritable storehouse of legends and events of Burke Countyâ€™s earlier days. He told me that the verses Frankie had allegedly written were composed by a Methodist minister whose surname was Stacy.</i></b>
