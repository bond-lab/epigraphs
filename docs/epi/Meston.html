                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Once on a time, no matter when,
     Some Glunimies met in a glen;
     As deft and tight as ever wore
     A durk, a targe, and a claymore,
     Short hose, and belted plaid or trews,
     In Uist, Lochaber, Skye, or Lewes,
     Or coverâ€™d hard head with his bonnet;
     Had you but known them, you would own it.</i></b>
