                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"Nothing shall assuage 
Your love hut marriage: for such is 
The tying of two in wedlock, as is 
The tuning of two lutes in one key: for 
Striking the strings of the one, straws will stir 
Upon the strings of the other; and in 
Two minds linked in love, one cannot be 
Delighted, but the other rejoiceth."</i></b>
