                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"There can be no scholar without the heroic mind. The preamble of thought, the transition through which it passes from the unconscious to the conscious, is action. Only so much do I know, as I have lived. Instantly we know whose words are laded with life, and whose not. 
The world, -- this shadow of the soul, or other me -- lies wide around. Its attractions are the keys which unlock my thoughts and make me acquainted with myself. I run eagerly into this resounding tumult."</i></b>
