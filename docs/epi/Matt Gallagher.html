                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the desert
I saw a creature, naked, bestial, 
Who, squatting upon the ground, 
Held his heart in his hands,
And ate of it.
I said, "Is it good, friend?"
"It is bitter -- bitter," he answered; 
"But I like it
"Because it is bitter,
And because it is my heart."</i></b>
