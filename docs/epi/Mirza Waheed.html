                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When I witness ups and downs, banks and demarcations, 
I lose my temper,
I seek oneness and equality, for that
I run and foam and fret;
Hence is it that, water though I am,
I have fallen on the burning coals of the mulberry-woods.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We know their dream; enough
To know they dreamed and are dead;
And what if excess of love
Bewildered them till they died?
...
Wherever green is worn,
Are changed, changed utterly;
A terrible beauty is born.</i></b>
