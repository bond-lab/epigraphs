                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When a conjecture inspires new hopes or creates new fears, actions is indicated. There is an important assymetry between hope, which leads to actions which will test its basis, and fear, which leads to restriction of options frequently preventing any attempt at [testing]. As we know only too well, many of our hopes do not survive their test. However, fears accumulate untested. Our inventory of untested fears has always made humanity disastrously vulnerable to thought control. Independent science's greatest triumph was the reduction of that vulnerability.
