                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Smooth went our boat along the summer seas,
Leaving-for so it seemed-a world behind,
Its cares, its sounds, its shadows; we reclined
Upon the sunny deck, heard but the breeze
That whispered through the palms, or idly played
With the lithe flag aloft-a forest scene
On either side drew its slope line of green,
And hung the water's edge with shade.
Above thy woods, Memphis, pyramids pale
Peered as we passed; and Nile's soft azure hue,
Gleaming 'mid the gray desert, met the view;
Where hung at intervals the scarce seen sail.
Oh! were this little boat to us the world,
As thus we wandered far from sounds of care,
Circled with friends, and gentle maidens fair,
While southern airs the waving pennant curled,
How sweet were life's long voyage, till in peace
We gained that haven still, where all things cease!</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Day after day thy bloom
Fades, and the tender lustre of thine eye
Is dimm'd; thy form, amid creation, seems
The only dropping thing. Thy look was soft, 
And yet most animated, and thy step
Light as the foe's upon the mountains. Now,
Thou sittest hopeless, pale beneath the tree
That fann'd its joyless leaves above thy hand,
Where love had deck'd the blooming bow'r, and strew'd
The sweets of summer.</i></b>
