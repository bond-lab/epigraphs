                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>England, we love thee better than we know-
And this I learnt when, after wanderings long
'Mid people of another stock and tongue,
I heard, at length, thy martial music blow,
And saw thy warrior children to and fro
Pace, keeping ward at one of those huge gates
Which, like twin giants, guard th' Herculanean Straits.</i></b>
