<li>IN: <i>Woman At Sea</i> (2008) Fiction, French
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>O you singer, solitary, singing by yourself -- projecting me;
O solitary me, listening -- nevermore shall I cease perpetuating you;
Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,
Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,
Never again leave me to to be the peaceful child I was before what there,
in the night,
By the sea, under the yellow and sagging moon,
The messenger there arous'd -- the fire, the sweet hell within,
The unknown want, the destiny of me.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking</i>,  (1859), Poem, US
