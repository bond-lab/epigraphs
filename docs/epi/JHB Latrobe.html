                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It was midnight on the first of October, 1811, that the New Orleans dropped anchor opposite the town... The roar of the escaping steam, then heard for the first time at the place where, now, its echoes are unceasing, roused the population, and, late as it was, crowds came rushing to the bank of the river to learn the cause of the unwanted uproar. A letter now before me, written by one of those on board, at the time, records the fact that there were those who insisted that the comet of 1811 had fallen into the Ohio and had produced the hubbub!</i></b>
