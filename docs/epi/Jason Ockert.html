<li>IN: <i>Neighbors of Nothing</i> (2013) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It is winter and the new year.
Nobody knows you.
Away from the stars, from the rain of light,
You lie under the weather of stones.
There is no thread to lead you back.
Your friends doze in the dark
Of pleasure and cannot remember.
Nobody knows you. You are the neighbor of nothing.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Elegy for My Father</i>,  (1978), Poem, US/Canada
