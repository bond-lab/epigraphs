                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In one great gulp I drank my tea and gazed
Upon the grim and gloomy world anew -- 
And gasped at how my griping eye had lied.
The rain still fell, the wind still blew, but now
I thought it grand! I love the rain!
Not rain nor cloud did cloud my eye -- 'twas thirst!</i></b>
