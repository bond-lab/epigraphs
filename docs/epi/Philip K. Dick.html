Ah Ben!
Say how, or when Shall we thy Guests
Meet at those Lyrick Feasts, Made at the Sun, The Dog, the triple Tunne?
Where we such clusters had,
As made us nobly wild, not mad; And yet each Verse of thine
Out-did the meate, out-did the frolick wine.
My Ben
Or come agen: Or send to us,
Thy wits great over-plus; But teach us yet Wisely to husband it;
Lest we that Talent spend:
And having once brought to an end That precious stock; the store
Of such a wit the world should have no more.</i></b>
