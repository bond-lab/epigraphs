                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>She comes not when Noon is on the roses -
Too bright is Day.
She comes not to the Soul till it reposes.
From work and play.
But when Night is on the hills, and the great Voices
Roll in from the sea
By starlight and by candlelight and dreamlight
She comes to me.</i></b>
