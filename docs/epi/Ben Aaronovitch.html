                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Through the streets our wheels slowly move;
The toll of the death bell dismays us.
With nosegays and gloves we are deck'd,
So trim and so gay they array us.
The passage all crowded we see
With maidens that move us with pity;
Our air all, admiring agree
Such lads are not left in the city.
Oh! Then to the tree I must go;
The judge he has ordered the sentence.
And then comes a gownsman you know,
And tells a dull tale of repentence.
By the gullet we're ty'd very tight;
We beg all spectators, pray for us.
Our peepers are hid from the light,
The tumbril shoves off, and we morrice.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The problem of the house is a problem of the epoch. The equilibrium of society today depends upon it. Architecture has for its first duty, in this period of renewal, that of bringing about a revision of values, a revision of the constituent elements of the house. We must create the mass production spirit.</i></b>

Daunced ful ofte in many a grene made.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I would say to them as they shook in their fear,
   "Now what is your paltry book,
Or the Phidian touch of the chisel's point,
   That can make the marble look,
To this monster of ours, that for ages lay
   In the depths of the dreaming earth,
Till we brought him out with a cheer and a shout,
   And hammer'd him into birth?"</i></b>
