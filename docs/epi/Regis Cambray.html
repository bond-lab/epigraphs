                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Sheherezade dismembered narrative: every story she told ended on the cliffhanger of dawn and resumed on the edge of night, but the two pieces, the starting and the continuation, didn't fit exactly, and in that gap there was something not yet explained, something that historians tried to fill with bits of history, psychologists with sex, and theorists with theory. Perhaps these gaps that advanced the story cycles and kept them going were places where Sharyar and Dinarzad's intervention took place, they were the collaborative interpellations of the other two members of the threesome.</i></b>
