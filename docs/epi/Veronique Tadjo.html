                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>This story is true, because it is anchored in reality, sunk deep into real life. But it is false as well, because it is the product of a literary endeavor where what really matters is not so much the accurary of the facts, but the intention behind the writing. Everything has been revised, reworked, reorganized. Some details have been muted, others, in contrast, emphasized. In short, what remains is a lie, or perhaps a joke on memory's part, a trick of the spoken word.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the world where we live today, before doing something we must each think; we must think long and hard because what we say heads off on its own -- it doesn't stay here. So when someone comes and asks, "Whos said that?" you will reply with his name, "It was Kaku Adingala who said it." "Really? And where is this Adingala from?" You will say he comes from Siman. Then the person will ask you, "Who is his ancestor?" Maybe he already knows, but you will say, "His ancestor is old Assemian Eci." And then he will reply, "Say no more. What you have said is true."</i></b>
