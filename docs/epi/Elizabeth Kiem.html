                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Seems like nothing I said 
Ever meant anything
But a headline over my head. 
Thought I made a stand
Only made a scene. 
There's no feast for the underfed. 
All the unknown, dying or dead
Keep showing up in my dreams. 
I'll shut up and carry on. 
The scream becomes a yawn.</i></b>
