                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Heaven got sweeter, its paperweight curve
star-crazy at its purple center.
She’d found a god, a weapon in the works.
Something I hadn’t noticed in the field
fought out of the layers and took her.
I tore away the land’s every color,
withered the smallest grasses.  Every heartbeat
went blank, I dismantled the ticking.
 
They only say what I took, not what I gave:
roots and strong light, glory
in the single shoot, green currency
of the just-born.  From the irredeemable,
the buried—this is how a self gets made.
Remember, that darkness contained the seed
sealed in the swollen red globe.
Hell had to pay</i></b>
