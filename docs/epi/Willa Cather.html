It took me awhile to get away from Marty McGraw.
"The first night I went to Whitfield's place," I told Elaine.
Elaine was gone by the time I woke up.

The next couple of days were a three-ring circus for the media.
I couldn't do much in what was left of that afternoon.
I called Viaticom a few minutes after nine the next morning…
I stayed put over the weekend.
You'd have thought it was a social call.
It was a long night.
You could almost say he'd been asking for it.

SCUDDER: Please state your name for the record.

Rich and sombre and always silent; 
The miles of fresh-plowed soil, 
Heavy and black, full of strength and harshness; 
The growing wheat, the growing weeds, 
The toiling horses, the tired men; 
The long empty roads, 
Sullen fires of sunset, fading, 
The eternal, unresponsive sky. 
Against all this,
 Youth, Flaming like the wild roses, 
Singing like the larks over the plowed fields,
 Flashing like a star out of the twilight; 
Youth with its insupportable sweetness, 
Its fierce necessity,
 Its sharp desire,</i></b>

When the smoky clouds hung low in the west and the red sun went down behind them, leaving a pink flush on the snowy roofs and the blue drifts, then the wind sprang up afresh, with a kind of bitter song, as if it said: "This is reality, whether you like it or not. All those frivolities of summer, the light and shadow, the living mask of greent that trembled over everything, they were lies, and this is what was underneath. This is the truth.</i></b>
