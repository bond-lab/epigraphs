                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>Enshadowed</i> (2012) Fiction, Young Adult Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Oh, lady bright! can it be right— 
This window open to the night? 
The wanton airs, from the tree-top, 
Laughingly through the lattice drop— 
The bodiless airs, a wizard rout, 
Flit through thy chamber in and out, 
And wave the curtain canopy 
So fitfully—so fearfully— 
Above the closed and fringéd lid 
’Neath which thy slumb’ring soul lies hid, 
That, o’er the floor and down the wall, 
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall! 
Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Sleeper</i>,  (1831), Poem, US
