                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It's raining women's voices as if they had died even in memory
And it's raining you as well marvelous encounters of my life
O little drops
Those rearing clouds begin to neigh a whole universe of auricular cities
Listen if it rains while regret and disdian weep to an ancient music
Listen to the bonds fall off which hold you above and below</i></b>
