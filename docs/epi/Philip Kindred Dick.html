The animal, called Tu'imalila, died at the royal palace ground in the Tongan capital of Nuku, Alofa. The people of Tonga regarded the animal as a chief, and special keepers were appointed to look after it. It was blinded in a bush fire a few years ago. Tonga radio said Tu'imalila's carcass would be sent to the Auckland Museum in New Zealand."</i></b>
