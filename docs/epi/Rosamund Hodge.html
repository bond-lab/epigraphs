                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A glooming peace this morning with it brings, 
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head. 
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; 
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished: 
For never was a story of more woe 
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</i></b>
