<li>IN: <i>Ghost Flower</i> (2012) Fiction, Young Adult Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, 
And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, 
And the dry stone no sound of water. Only 
There is shadow under this red rock, 
(Come in under the shadow of this red rock), 
And I will show you something different from either 
Your shadow at morning striding behind you 
Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you; 
I will show you fear in a handful of dust</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Wasteland</i>,  (1922), Poem, UK
