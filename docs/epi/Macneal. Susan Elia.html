                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the higher ranges or Secret Service work, the actual facts in many cases were in every respect equal to the most fantastic inventions of romance and melodrama. Tangle within tangle, plot and counter-plot, ruse and treachery, cross and double-cross, true agent, false agent, double agent, gold and steel, the bomb, the daggar and the firing party, were interwoven in many a texture so intricate as to be incredible and yet true. The Chief and the High Officers of the Secret Service reveled in these subterranean labyrinths, and pursued their task with cold and silent passion.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I reckon they must have
Forgotten about me
When I hear them say they gonna 
Save Democracy.
Funny thing about white folks
Wanting to go and fight
Way over in Europe
For freedom and light
When right here in Alabama --
Lord have mercy on me! -- 
They declare I'm a Fifth Columnist
If I say the word, Free.
Jim Crow all around me.
Don't have the right to vote.
Let's leave our neighbour's eye alone
And look after our own mote -- 
Cause I sure don't understand
What the meaning can be 
When folks talk about freedom --
And Jim Crow me?</i></b>
