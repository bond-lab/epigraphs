                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Go then, my little Book, and show to all 
That entertain, and bid thee welcome shall, 
What thou dost keep close shut up in ty breast;
And wish what thou dost show them choose to be blest 
To them for good, may make them choose to be 
Pilgrims better, by far, than thee or me. 
Tell them of Mercy; she is one 
Who early hath her pilgrimage begun. 
Yea, let young damsels learn of her to prize 
The world which is to come, and so be wise; 
For little tripping maids may follow God 
Along the ways which saintly feet have trod.</i></b>
