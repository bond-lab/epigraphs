                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Kilmeny looked up with a lovely grace, 
But nae smile was seen on Kilmeny's face; 
As still was her look, and as still was her ee, 
As the stillness that lay on the emerant lea, 
Or the mist that sleeps on a waveless sea. 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . 
Such beauty bard may never declare, 
For there was no pride nor passion there; 
. . . . . . . . . . . . .
Her seymar was the lily flower, 
And her cheek the moss-rose in the shower; 
And her voice like the distant melodye 
That floats along the twilight sea. </i></b>

The morning-star of Memory!</i></b>
