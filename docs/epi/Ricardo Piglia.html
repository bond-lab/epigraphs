                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The story goes on; it can go on; there are various possible conjectures; it's still open; it merely gets interrupted. The investigation has no end; it cannot end. Someone should invent a new literary genre, paranoid fiction. Everyone is a suspect; everyone feels pursued.</i></b>
