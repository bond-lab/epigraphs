                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You are in a very high tree. 

If you jump
you will live a full life 
while falling.

You will get married
to a hummingbird

and raise beautiful part-
hummingbirds. 

You will die of cancer
in mid-air.

I will not lie.
It will be painful.

You are a brave little boy
or girl.</i></b>
