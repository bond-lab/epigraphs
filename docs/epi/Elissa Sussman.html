                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There once were four sisters 
Who were exceptionally ordinary,
But desired more than a maiden should desire. 

Ravaged by their shameful wants 
Their loving hearts never bloomed 

Instead four wicked brambles
Grew in their place 
Each tainted 
With poisonous magic.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Recall the four sisters 
(Extraordinary! Extraordinary!) 
Who fought for others to be saved 

They were ravaged by a shameful war
Though their loving hearts were brave 

And so a vengeful bramble 
Grew thick upon their graves 
Each thistle then sharpened 
By the hands of former slaves</i></b>
