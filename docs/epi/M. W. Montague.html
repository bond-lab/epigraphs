                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We travellers are in very hard circumstances. If we say nothing but what has been said before us, we are dull, and we have observed nothing. If we tell any thing new, we are laughed at as fabulous and romantic ; not allowing either for the differ ence of rank, (which affords difference of company,) or more curiosity, or change of customs that happens every twenty years in every country.</i></b>
