                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Flight
What creatures these,
Broken and reformed
In nests hanging
By a threat,
Hidden in rusty leaves
Away from predators' eyes?
Do they know 
When spinning silken coffins
That fear of the unknown
And the agony of recreation
Must pay the price
Of precious freedom?</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>Desperado</i> (2015) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Soft and sweet like a lullaby, She came to me 'neath a summer sky, Filled my life with immeasurable grace, With a gentle smile and a hint of lace. 
Annabel, oh, Annabel. What I'd give for one more smile, Or to sit and talk to you for a while. Annabel, Annabel, where did you go? Won't you come back home for the winter snow? 
She taught me how to live and love, Like an angel sent here from above, For a time this girl was mine to hold, 'Til she went in search of a future bold. 
Annabel, oh, Annabel. What I'd give for one more day, With you by my side for a day of play. Annabel, Annabel the joy you bring. Won't you come back home for the flowers of spring? 
I know she's in a happier place, With constant sunlight on her face, Someday she'll visit us, this I know, Once she's spread her wings and learned to grow. 
Annabel, oh, Annabel. Think of me where'er you are, Whether close to home or miles afar. Annabel, Annabel, you're etched on my heart, You'll be there with me through this brand-new start.</i></b>
