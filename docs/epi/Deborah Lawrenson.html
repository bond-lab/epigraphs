                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There comes a murmur from the shore, 
And in the place two fair streams are,
Drawn from the purple hills afar,
Drawn down unto the restless sea. 
The hills whose flowers ne'er fed the bee,
The shore no ship has ever seen,
Still beaten by the billows green,
Whose murmur comes unceasingly
Unto the place for which I cry.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>A Garden by the Sea</i>,  (1891), Poem, UK
