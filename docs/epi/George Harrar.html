                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Tis a pleasant thing, from the shore,
 to behold the drowning of another ... not
because it is a grateful pleasure for 
anyone to be in misery, but because it is 
a pleasant thing to see those misfortunes
from which you yourself are free.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>On the Nature of Things</i>,  (-50), Poem, Italy
