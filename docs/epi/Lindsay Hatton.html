<li>IN: <i>Monterey Bay</i> (2016) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>This coast crying out for tragedy like all beautiful places: and like the passionate spirit of humanity
Pain for its bread: God's, many victims', the painful deaths, the horrible transfigurements: I said in my heart,
"Better invent than suffer: imagine victims 
Lest your own flesh be chosen the agonist, or you
Martyr some creature to the beauty of the place."</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Apology for Bad Dreams</i>,  (1925), Poem, US
