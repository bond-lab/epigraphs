                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Dear Massa Swille:
What it was?
I have done my Liza Leap
& am safe in the arms
of Canada, so
Ain't no use your Slave
Catchers waitin on me
At Trailways
I won't be there

I flew in non-stop
Jumbo jet this A. M. Had
Champagne
Compliments of the Cap'n
Who announced that a 
Runaway Negro was on the
Plane. Passengers came up
And shook my hand
& within my hand
& within 10 min. I had
Signed up for 3 anti-slavery
Lectures. Remind me to get an Agent

Traveling in style
Beats craning your neck after
The North Star and hiding in
Bushes anytime, Massa
Besides, your Negro dogs
Of Hays & Allen stock can't 
Fly

By now I s'pose that
Yellow Judas Cato done tole
You that I have snuck back to 
The plantation 3 maybe 4 times
Since I left the first time

Last visit I slept in
Your bed and sampled your
Cellar. Had your prime
Quadroon give me
She-Bear. Yes, yes

You was away at a 
Slave auction at Ryan's Mart
In Charleston & so I knowed
You wouldn't mind
Did you have a nice trip, Massa?

I borrowed your cotton money
to pay for my ticket & to get
Me started in this place called
Saskatchewan Brrrrrrrr!
It's cold up here but least
Nobody is collaring hobbling gagging
Handcuffing yoking chaining & thumbscrewing
You like you is they hobby horse

The Mistress Ms. Lady
Gived me the combination
To your safe, don't blame
The feeble old soul, Cap'n
I told her you needed some

More money to shop with & 
You sent me from Charleston
To get it. Don't worry
Your employees won't miss
It & I accept it as a 
Down payment on my back
Wages

I must close now
Massa, by the time you gets
This letter old Sam will have
Probably took you to the
Deep Six

That was rat poson I left
In your Old Crow</i></b>
