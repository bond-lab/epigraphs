                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Who is the third who walks always beside you?
When I count, there are only you and I together
But when I look ahead up the white road
There is always another one walking beside you
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded
I do not now whether a man or a woman
-- But who is that on the other side of you?</i></b>
