                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Day after day thy bloom
Fades, and the tender lustre of thine eye
Is dimm'd; thy form, amid creation, seems
The only dropping thing. Thy look was soft, 
And yet most animated, and thy step
Light as the foe's upon the mountains. Now,
Thou sittest hopeless, pale beneath the tree
That fann'd its joyless leaves above thy hand,
Where love had deck'd the blooming bow'r, and strew'd
The sweets of summer.</i></b>

In war, he mounts the warrior's steed;
In halls, in gay attire is seen;
In hamlets, dances on the green.
Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,
And men below, and saints above,
For love is heav'n, and heav'n is love.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There be, perhaps, who barren hearts avow,
Cold as the rocks on Torneo's hoary brow;
There be, whose loveless wisdom never fail'd,
In self-adoring pride securely mail'd;
But triumph not, ye peace-enamour'd few;
Fire, nature, genius, never dwelt with you!
For you no fancy consecrates the scene,
Where rapture utter'd vows, and wept between;
'Tis your's, unmov'd, to sever and to meet;
No pledge is sacred, and no home is sweet.</i></b>
