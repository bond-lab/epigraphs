                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>One day as I was painting, black invaded the whole canvas, without shape or contrast or transparency.
In that extreme I saw a kind of negation of black. 
The differences in texture reflected more or less faintly the light, and a light emanated from the darkness, a pictorial light the emotional power of which stimulated my desire to paint.
My instrument was no longer the dark, but that secret light that came from the dark.</i></b>
