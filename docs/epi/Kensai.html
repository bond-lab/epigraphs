                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>They looking back, all the Eastern side beheld
Of paradise, so late their happy seat,
Waved over by that flaming brand, the gate 
With dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms:
The world was all before them, where to choose
Their place of rest, and Providence their guide;
They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,
THrough Eden took their solitary way.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Paradise Lost Book XII</i>,  (1667), Poem, UK
