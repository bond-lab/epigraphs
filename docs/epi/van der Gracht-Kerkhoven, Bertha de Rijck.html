                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You say: those letters have no historical value. Maybe so. But the fact remains that younger generations are often better served by the 'side-lights', which offer a much clearer picture of the conditions prevailing at the time, and especially of the mentality of those days, than for instance lists of figures. The family businesses are no more, but we can bring the people to life again by reading about their thoughts and feelings.</i></b>
