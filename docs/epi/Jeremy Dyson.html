                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There's a wonderful paper by Schopenhauer, called 'An Apparent Intention of the Fate of the Individual', in which he points out that when you are at a certain age and look back over life, it seems to be almost as orderly as a composed novel. And just as in Dickens' novels, little accidental meetings and so forth turn out to be main features in the plot, so in your life. And what seem to have been mistakes at the time turn out to be directive crises. And then he asks: 'Who wrote this novel?'</i></b>
