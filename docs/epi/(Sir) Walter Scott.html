                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In peace, love tunes the shepherd's reed;
In war, he mounts the warrior's steed;
In halls, in gay attire is seen;
In hamlets, dances on the green.
Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,
And men below, and saints above,
For love is heav'n, and heav'n is love.</i></b>
