                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I have persectuted the natives of England beyond all reason. 
Whether gentle or simple I have cruelly oppressed them, 
Many I unjustly disinherited; innumberable multitudes 
perished through me by famine or the sword. 
Having gained the throne of that kingdom by so many crimes, 
I dare not leave it to anyone but God.</i></b>
