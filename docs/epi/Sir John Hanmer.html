                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Emblem art thou of Time, memorial Stream!
Which in ten thousand fancies, being here,
We waste, or use, or fashion, as we deem;
But, if its backward voice comes ever near,
As thine beside the ruins, how doth it seem
Solemn and stern, sepulchral and severe!</i></b>
