                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>First Law: A body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion will remain in motion with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by force. 
Second Law: Force is equal to the change in momentum (mV) per change in time. For a constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma). 
Third Law: For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.</i></b>
