                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The possessor of this stone can fly in the air, and dive not only under water, but underground. He cannot be wounded as long as he has this stone on his body, that is, in his mouth, under his hairknot, in his hands, or under his armpits. He will be free from fatigue and disease... [These] powers do not really belong to him, but only to the stone, which by mere touch can turn lead into silver and brass into gold... Thus, when an alchemist has discovered the "stone of live metal" he exposes himself to the danger of being robbed of it by evil spirits or jealous rivals... Evil spirits will be on the lookour for him out of sheer malice, but the jealous rivals wish to eat his body, because by eating it, they will come to possess superhuman strength.</i></b>
