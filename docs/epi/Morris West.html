                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I've always wondered about Lazarus.
He had walked through the gates of death.
He had seen what was on the other side.
Did he want to return to life?
Did he thank Jesus for bringing him back?
What kind of man was he afterwards?
How did the world look to him?
How did he look to the world?</i></b>
