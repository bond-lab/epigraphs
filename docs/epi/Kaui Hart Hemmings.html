                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My twenty-two-month old toddler was shoved facedown from the top of the slide at Cow Hollow Playground by a three-year-old, non English-speaking bully. The parents don't speak English, nor do the kids. I think they are some sort of Eastern Europe or maybe Chinese. There were three other children, who were all throwing rocks and the parents didn't care! When I tried to talk to the parents, they just smiled and said, "Is not okay?" I know there's a cultural element to such behavior, but it can be maddeningly frustrating. What can cops do about this? Should I call Immigration Services???</i></b>
