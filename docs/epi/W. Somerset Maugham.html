                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There was a merchant in Baghdad who sent his servant to market to buy provisions andin a little while the servant came back, white and trembling and said Master, just now when I was in the marketplace I was jostled by a woman in the crowd and when I turned, I saw it was Death who jostled me. She looked at me and made a threatening gesture; now lend me your horse, and I will ride away from this city and avoid my fate. I will go to Samarra and there, Death will not find me. The merchant lent him his horse, and the servant mounted it, and he dug his spurs in its flanks and as fast as the horse could gallop, he went. Then the merchant went down to the marketplace and he came to me and said, Why did you make a threatening gesture to my servant when you saw him this morning? That was not a threatening gesture, I said , it was only a start of surprise. I was astonished to see him in Baghdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.</i></b>
