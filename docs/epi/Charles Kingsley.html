                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I heard a thousand blended notes,
  While in a grove I sate reclined, 
 In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts 
  Bring sad thoughts to the mind. 
  
 To her fair works did Nature link 
  The human soul that through me ran; 
 And much it grieved my heart to think 
  What man has made of man.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Beyond the shadow of the ship
I watch'd the water-snakes:
They moved in tracks of shining white,
And when they rear'd, the elfish light
Fell off in hoary flakes.
***
O happy living things! no tongue
Their beauty might declare:
A spring of love gush'd from my heart,
And I bless'd them unaware.</i></b>
