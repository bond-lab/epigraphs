                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>At that word the young man let his glass slip through his fingers, and looked upon Keawe like a ghost. 
'The price,' says he; 'the price! You do not know the price?'
'It is for that I am asking you,' returned Keawe. 'But why are you so much concerned?' Is there something wrong about the price?'
'It has dropped a great deal in value since your time, Mr. Keawe,' said the young man, stammering.
'Well, well, I shall have the less to pay for it,' says Keawe. 'How much did it cost you?'
The young man was white as a sheet. 'Two cents,' said he.
'What?' cried Keawe, 'two cents? Why, then, you can only sell it for one. And he who buys it --' The words died upon Keawe's tongue; he who bought it could never sell it again, the bottle and the bottle imp must abide with him until he died, and when he died must carry him to the red end of hell.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>“How do you know she is a unicorn?” Molly demanded. “And why were you afraid to let her touch you? I saw you. You were afraid of her.” 
“I doubt that I will feel like talking for very long,” the cat replied without rancor. “I would not waste time in foolishness if were you. As to your first question, no cat out of its first fur can ever be deceived by appearances. Unlike human beings, who enjoy them. As for your second question—” Here he faltered, and suddenly became very interested in washing; nor would he speak until he had licked himself fluffy and then licked himsefl smooth again. Even then he would not look at Molly, but examined his claws.
“If she had touched me," he said very softly, "I would have been hers and not my own, not ever again."</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, "I do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?"
"Oh, yes," replied Dorothy.
"Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world. There we still have witches and wizards among us."</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>One evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little tremulously, 'I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.' The light was within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur, 'Oh, nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed.
“Anything approaching the change that came over his features I have never seen before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasn't touched. I was fascinated. It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that ivory face the expression of sombre pride, of ruthless power, of craven terror—of an intense and hopeless despair. Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision—he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath:
“'The horror! The horror!'</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.</i></b>
