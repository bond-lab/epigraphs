You didn't make me blind
Thank you O Lord

You didn't give me a hump
Thank you O Lord

You didn't make my father an alkie
Thank you O Lord

You didn't give me water on the brain
Thank you O Lord

You didn't make me a stutterer a gimp a midget epileptic hermaphrodite a horse moss or something from the flora or fauna
Thank you O Lord

But why did you make me a Pole?</i></b>
