in euery doome, Since wicked CATILINE went out,
And quitted Rome? One while, we thought him innocent;
And, then accus'd The Consul for his malice spent;
And power abus'd. Since, that we heare, he is in armes,
We thinke not so: Yet charge the Consul, with our harmes,
That let him goe. So, in our censure of the state,
We still do wander; And make the carefull magistrate
The marke of slander.</i></b>

For boorish Artemon has cravings amorous.
He used to go out shabby and threadbare
With wooden earrings poking from his hair.
Wrapped in a smelly oxhide cloak
Repurposed from a shield, he was a joke,
A good-for-nothing crook and a bore,
Seen now with cook, now with whore,
Making a criminal living.
Often I saw him in the stocks, giving
A yelp as he was slapped about
And had his hair and beard plucked out.
But now the son of Kyke appears
In a chariot, with gold rings in his ears,
Carrying an ivory sunshade-
Worthy of a pretty maid?</i></b>
