                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Her skywards gaze inspired my imagination,
compelling my eyes to mirror her action, 
and I looked upon the sun for longer men usually are able.

More power is allowed there than here
by the nature of the virtue of that place,
the true home of the human species.

Still I could not bear the shine for long;
I was only able but to glance at the light's rolling sparkle,
like molten iron escaping from the fire.

Then suddenly the day blared too bright,
as if the One Who Has The Power
had adorned the heavens with another sun.

Her eyes remained fixed on the eternal circles;
even as I turned away from the light;
And set my eyes back upon her.

Now seeing her, I began to change
as once mortal Glaucus changed after eating an herb that
allowed him to roam the sea in the company of the gods.

Such superhuman transformations cannot be
expressed in words; let this story serve as a smile
until grace grant you the experience.</i></b>
