                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>If yonder raindrop should its heart disclose, 
Behold therein a hundred sea displayed.
In every atom, if thou gaze aright,
Thousands of reasoning beings are contained. 
The gnat in limbs doth match the elephant.
In name is yonder drop as Nile's broad flood. 
In every grain a thousand harvests dwell.
The world within a grain of millet's heart. 
The universe in the mosquito's wing contained.
Upon one little spot within the heart
Resteth the Lord and Master of the worlds.
Therein two worlds commingled may be seen... </i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Secret Garden</i>,  (1350), Book, Iran
