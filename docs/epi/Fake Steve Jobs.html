                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Sometimes I feel like a great chef
who has devoted his entire life
to monastic study of the art of cooking
& gathered the finest ingredients
& built the most advanced kitchen
& prepared the most exquisite meal
so perfect, so delicious, so extraordinary
more astounding than any meal ever created
yet each day I stand in my window
& watch ninety-seven percent of the world
walk past my restuarant
into the mcdonald's
across the street.</i></b>
