                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Hush little baby 
My poor little thing 
You've been shuffled about 
Like a pawned wedding ring 
It must seem strange 
Love was here then gone 
And the Oklahoma sunrise
Becomes the Amarillo dawn 
What's important in this life? 
Ask the man 
Who's lost his wife</i></b>
