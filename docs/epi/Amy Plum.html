                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It took the view of the earth from space... to let us sense a planet on which living things, the air, the oceans, and the rocks all combine in one as Gaia. The name of the super-organism, Gaia, is not a synonym for the biosphere... Just as teh shell is part of a snail, so the rocks, the air, and the oceans are a part of Gaia. Gaia, as we shall see, has continuity with the past back to the origins of life, and extends into the future as long as life persists.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I'm a scientist, not a theologian. I don't know if there is a God or not. Religion requires certainty. Revere and respect Gaia. Have trust in Gaia. But not faith.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>...In addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche... there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals. This collective unconscious does not develop individually but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms... which give definite form to certain pyschic contents.</i></b>

You my Love whom I Love and die for?</i></b>
