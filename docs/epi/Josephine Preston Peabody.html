                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>But it was still needful that a life should be given to espiate that ancient sin, -- the theft of fire. It happened that Chiron, noblest of all the Centaurs (who are half horses and half men), was wandering the world in agony from a wound that the had received by strange michance. For, at a certain wedding-feast among the Lapith√¶ of Thessaly, one of the turbulent Centaurs had attempted to steal away the bride. A fierce struggle followed, and in the general confusion, Chiron, blameless as he was, had been wounded by a poisoned arrow. Ever tormented with the hurt and never to be healed, the immortal Centaur longed for death, and begged that he might be accepted as an atonement for Prometheus. The gods heard his prayer and took away his pain and his immortality. He died like my wearied man, and Zeus set him as a shining archer among the stars.</i></b>
