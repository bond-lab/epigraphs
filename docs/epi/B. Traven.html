                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Now stop that crying, honey dear, The Jackson Square remains still here In sunny New Orleans In lovely Louisiana. She thinks me buried in the sea, No longer does she wait for me In sunny New Orleans In lovely Louisiana. The death ship is it I am in, All I have lost, nothing to win So far off sunny New Orleans So far off lovely Louisana.</i></b>
