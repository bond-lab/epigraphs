                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people, and then they take themselves out of the slums. The world would mold men by changing their environment. Christ changes men, who then change their environment. The world would shape human behaviour, but Christ can change human nature.</i></b>
