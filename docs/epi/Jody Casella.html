                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>All foot covering must be removed. This practice is a requirement for successful entry and not merely a symbolic gesture of humility upon approaching a sacred space. 
Stones or rocks serve as an indication of the border between this world and the Other. Additionally, the stones themselves may hold magical properties. (No doubt you have heard of the Spirit said to reside in all manner of natural and inanimate objects.) 
Even scholars debate about that moment when the soul enters the body, the common notion being when the mother feels the first stirrings of life in her womb. The soul's departure (death) - if such event should occur in the same physical space -- creates a permanent fissure in the boundary. 
As to the nature of the environment, the personal accounts are similar in describing a cold, mist-like substance. Reports one observer: "It was like the air itself had turned itself to liquid ice. And long after I returned, I could still sense the creep of it in my very bones."</i></b>
