                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>So, I soberly laid my last plan
To extinguish the man.
Round his creep-hole, with never a break
Ran my fires for his sake;
Over-head, did my thunder combine
With my underground mine:
Till I looked from my labour content
To enjoy the event.</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>Mortdecai</i> (1972) Fiction, British
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I am the man you see here plain enough: 
Grant I'm a beast, why, beasts must lead beasts' lives! 
Suppose I own at once to tail and claws; 
The tailless man exceeds me: but being tailed 
I'll lash out lion-fashion, and leave apes 
To dock their stump and dress their haunches up, 
My business is not to remake myself, 
But make the absolute best of what God made.

And as this cabin gets upholstery, 
That hutch should rustle with sufficient straw.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>...Bearing aloft another Ganymede 
On pinions imped, as 't were, but not past bearing, 
Nor unfit yet for the fowler's purposes; 
Feathered, in short, as a prince o' th'air – no moorgame. 
If Paracelsus weighs that jot, this tittle, 
God knows your atomy were ponderable – 
(Love weighing t'other pan down!) ... 
... in a word, 
In half a word's space, – let's say, ere you flinched,
Or Paracelsus wove one of those thoughts,
Lighter than lad's-love, delicate as death,
I'd draft you thither.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>From An Envoi to a Projected Work
And patiently, O Reader, I thee pray,
Take in good part this work as it is meant,
And grieve thee not with ought that I shall say,
Since with good will this book abroad is sent,
To tell men how in youth I did assay
What love did mean and now I it repent:
That musing me my friends might well beware.
And keep them free from all such pain and care.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,
Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink,
Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble
The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink,
Here now in his triumph where all things falter,
Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread,
As a good self-slain on his own strange altar,
Death lies dead.</i></b>
