                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You're crazy. You fall down, stand up and walk again, your ankles and your knees move but you start again as if you had wings. The ditch calls you, but it's no use you're afraid to stay, and if someone asks you why, maybe you turn around and say that a woman and a sane death a better death wait for you.</i></b>
