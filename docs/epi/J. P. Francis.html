                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>For winter's rain and ruins are over.
And all the season of snows and sins,
The days dividing lover and lover,
The light that loses, the night that wins;
And time remembered is grief forgotten.
And frosts are slain and flowers begotten,
And in green underwood and cover
Blossom by blossom the spring begins.</i></b>
