                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A rock was sticking out of the water, jagged and pointed, covered with moss -- a remnant of the Ice Age and of the glacier that had once gouged out this basin in the earth. It had withstood the rains, the snows, the frost, the heat. It was afraid of no one. It did not need redemption, it had already been redeemed.</i></b>
