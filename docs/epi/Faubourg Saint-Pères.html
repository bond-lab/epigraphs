                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>According to the writer Jorge Luis Borges, the idea of the Zahir comes from Islamic tradition and it thought to have arisen at some point in the eighteenth century. Zahir, in Arabic, means visible, present, incapable of going unnoticed. It is someone or something which, once we have come into contact with them or it, gradually occupies our every thought, until we can think of nothing else. This can be considered either a state of holiness or of madness.</i></b>
