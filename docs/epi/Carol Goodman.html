                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And now the flight
of sea hawks hints at pterodactyl blood
while ancient sunlight shimmers on the bay,
and our thoughts turn to love, which if it lasts
a year will flirt with immortality.
Vesuvius has nothing new to say,
haze-shrouded, calm. This all goes by so fast. 

There's more than one kind of catastrophe.</i></b>
