And killing sleeps beside the babe ne’er born,
When darkness stills the forests birds at noon,
In blood and fire Gwlad shall rise anew.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Lost another one today. A promising lad, he just disappeared from my study, leaving the fire to burn out and the plates uncleared. There is no sign of him in the castle, and the major dome knows nothing of him. A shame. I had high hopes.
I remained convinced that there is within men the capacity to know and manipulate the subtle arts. Many show an innate sensitivity to the Grym, which is the source of all life after all. If I can just find a way to increase their mental discipline and dampen down their innate curiosity, I am sure this experiment will succeed.</i></b>
