                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The traveller who goes there from our land, tired and weary of the oppressor and of the vicissitudes of life that dog his every step, can forget his poverty, his squalor, his degradation and his humiliation. In Africa he breathes a new life, a life of freedom and liberty, a life of wealth and honour, because there is no discrimination between a Hebrew and a Christian there. Every man can attend to his labour diligently and find a just reward for his toil.</i></b>
