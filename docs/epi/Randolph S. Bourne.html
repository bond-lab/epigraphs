                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In our artificial civilization many young people at twenty-five are still on the threshold of activity. As one looks back then, over eight or nine years, one sees a panorama of seemingly formidable length. So many crises, so many startling surprises, so many vivid joys and harrowing humiliations and disappointments, that one feels startingly old; one wonders if one will ever feel so old again.</i></b>
