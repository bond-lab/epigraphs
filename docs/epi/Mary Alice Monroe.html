<li>IN: <i>The Summer's End</i> (2015) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Piercing the layers of night with flames
that melt the long hours before dawn, 
the sun gently peels a shroud of fog
from the misted island. She embraces
the ripening surface of the earth, 

where houses wrapped in sleep emerge from darkness
like hundreds of seeds scattered along roadsides.
Streetlights are still burning. Beneath them,
cars pass. Weary ships with passengers
given time to rearrange the memories of night,
as the day spreads itself before them
like an unwanted offering.
Each unfilled hour, ticking
ahead on the clock in their minds.

A woman rises from bed to sit
at her window and wait for daylight
to take hold of the world
spinning into place. She is 
searching for a child, the ghost 
of a child, a scrap, his small voice
in the wind, a carved smile
on the face of the moon --
just any familiar sign
from one of a billion stars.

And while shrimp boats glide out to sea
on the rows of first light, she watches
a dolphin caught in the marsh
swimming an endless circle.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>What greater thing is there for two human souls,
than to feel that they are joined for life -- 
to strengthen each other in all labor,
to rest on each other in all sorrow,
to minister to each other in all pain,
to be one with each other
in silent unspeakable memories...</i></b>
