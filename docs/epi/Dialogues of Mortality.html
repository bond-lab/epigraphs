                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"The sheening of that strange bright city on the hill, barred by its high gates..."
"Barred from all, Phrastes?"
"From all, Eroton, who do not desire to enter it more strongly than they desire all other cities."
"Then it is barred indeed, and most men must let it go."
"Those who have once desired it cannot let it go, for its light flickers always on the roads they tread, to plague them like marsh fires. Even though they flee from it, it may drag them towards it as a magnet drags steel, and, though they may never enter its gates, its light will burn them as with fire, for that is its nature."
"Who then were the builders of this dangerous city?"
"Gods and men, Eroton; men seeking after gods, and gods who seek after men. Does it not appear to you that such a fabric, part artifact and part deifact, reared out of divine intimations and demands, and out of the mortal longings and imaginings that climb to meet these, must perpetually haunt the minds of men, wielding over them a strange wild power, intermittent indeed, but without end? So, anyhow, it has always proved."</i></b>
