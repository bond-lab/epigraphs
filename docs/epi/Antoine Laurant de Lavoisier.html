                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The impossibility of isolating nomenclature from science and science from nomenclature stems from the fact that all physical science is necessarily based on three things: the series of facts that constitue the science, the ideas that recall them, the words that express them... Since it is words that preserve ideas, and transmit them, the result is that languages cannot be perfected without perfecting science, nor science without language.</i></b>
