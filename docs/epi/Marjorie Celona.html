                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Y
That perfect letter. The wishbone, fork in the road, empty wineglass. The question we ask over and over. Why? Me with my arms outstretched, feet in first position. The chromosome half of us don't have. Second to last in the alphabet: almost there. Coupled with an L, let's make an adverb. A modest X, legs closed. Y or N? Yes, of course. Upsidedown peace sign. Little bird tracks in the sand.
 Y, a Greek letter, joined the Latin alphabet after the Romans conquered Greece in the first century-- a double agent: consonant and vowel. No one used adverbs before then, and no one was happy.</i></b>
