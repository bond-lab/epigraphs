                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A poet is like the birds of passage...
They pass singing in the distance, the world
Knows nothing of them except their voice...

I was singing, my friends, as a man breathes,
As a bird mourns, as the wind sighs, 
As murmurs float on flowing water.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Le Poete Mourant</i>,  (1823), Poem, France
