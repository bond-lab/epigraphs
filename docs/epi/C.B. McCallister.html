                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Elder looked across to Tamsin in the firelight. "Pay close attention when people tell you stories," he said. "At their core, every story you've ever heard comes down to two things. Someone goes on a long journey or a stranger comes to town." Tasmin considered this as the fire cackled. "But can't it sometimes be both?" The Elder looked at her for a long moment, like he was seeing something she was not. "Yes," he finally said, his voice grave. "Very occasionally, it can."</i></b>
