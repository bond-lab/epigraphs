                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I fled Him, down the nights and downt he days; 
... I fled Him down the labrinthine ways
Of my own mind...
I hid from Him... 
... 
That voice is round me like a bursting sea: 
Lo, all things fly thee, for thou fliest Me!... 
Rise, clasp my Hand, and come! </i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk, 
Though my own red roses there may blow;
It is little I repair tot he matches of the Southron folk, 
Though the red roses crest the caps, I know.
For the field is full of shades as I near the shadowy coast,
And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,
And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host
As the run-stealers flicker to and fro,
To and fro: -- 
O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!</i></b>

A weed, albeit an amaranthine weed,
Suffering no flowers except its own to mount?

Ah! must Thou char the wood er Thou canst limn with it?</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Know you what it is to be a child? It is to be something very different from the man of to-day. It is to have a spirit yet streaming from the waters of baptism; it is to believe in love, to believe in loveliness, to believe in belief; it is to be so little that the elves can reach to whisper in your ear; it is to turn pumpkins into coaches, and mice into horses, lowness into loftiness, and nothing into everything, for each child has its fairy godmother in its own soul; it is to live in a nutshell and to count yourself the king of infinite space; it is
        To see a world in a grain of sand,
        And a Heaven in a wild flower,
        Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
        And eternity in an hour;
it is to know not as yet that you are under sentence of life, nor petition that it be commuted into death.</i></b>
