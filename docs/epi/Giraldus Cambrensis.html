                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the common course of things, mankind progresses from the forest to the field, from the field to the town and to the social conditions of citizens; but this nation, holding agricultural labour in contempt, and little coveting the wealth of towns, as well as being exceedingly averse to civil instituitions, lead the same life their fathers did in the woods and open pastures, neither willing to abandon their old habits or learn anything new.</i></b>
