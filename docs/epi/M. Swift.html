                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Don't tell me there's something wrong with the kids. Because then you gotta tell me that the kids have been screwed up by the schools, and the schools are being screwed over by the parents. Then the parents -- they got screwed over by their jobs, by an economy that doesn't function, and the economy, that got messed up by the politicans, and the politicians, they get messed up by the press, and the press got screwed over by the punters, who got picked on by the banks, and before you know it, the problem is everyone who ever took out a tenner when they should have put a fiver into their savings account and took out a loan instead of a pension, and then -- then it's humanity that's the problem. It's the nature of what we are; it's the messed-up thing that sometimes gets called the human soul. You really going to do a fix on that?</i></b>
