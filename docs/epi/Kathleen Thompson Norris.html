                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>As years ago we carried to your knees 
The tales and treasures of eventful days, 
Knowing no deed too humble for your praise, 
Nor any gift too trivial to please, 
So still we bring, with older smiles and tears, 
What gifts we may, to claim the old, dear right; 
Your faith, beyond the silence and the night, 
Your love still close and watching through the years.</i></b>
