<li>IN: <i>The Secret Wisdom of the Earth</i> (2015) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Sweet are the uses of adversity,
which like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head; 
And this our life exempt from public haunt,
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in every thing. 
I would not change it.
</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>As You Like It</i>,  (1623), Play, UK
