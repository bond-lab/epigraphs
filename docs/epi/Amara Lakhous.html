                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I am a southerner, married, with a child a few months old. I ask no favors, only an apartment to rent, and I can give the highest guarantee of payment. I buy La Stampa every day, and I read with pleasure some article or item of news, good or bad, and finally my gaze falls on the classified ads. Even though I bombard the advertisers with telephone calls all day, starting early in the morning, I always find the line busy, and if someone should happen to answer, the first question I get is the following: "You're a southerner? I'm sorry, I can't." Or other responses too repellent to repeat, or perhaps, "Our rooms are quiet, and we don't want the disturbances that children cause." Since I don't have the privilege of at least explaining myself, and since as soon as I'm identified as southerner the excuse of the children comes up, I would like to address a few words to these people who are more civilized than me: I am and feel myself a Christian, and so I believe that all of us in the world are children of God. In all the nations of the world, without distinction between north and south, there are good people and bad, with children and without children. I personally deplore these ways of thinking: How can we celebrate the Centenary of Italian Unification with such feelings?</i></b>
