                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Have you hear that it was good to gain the day? / I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost / in the same spirit in which they are won... /
Vivas to those who have fail'd! / And to those whose war vessels sank in the sea! / And to those themselves who sank in the sea! / And to all generals that lost engagements, / And all overcome heroes / And the numberless unknown heroes equal / to the greatest heroes known! </i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Song of Myself</i>,  (1892), Poem, US
