                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>i dared to rest, or wander, - like a rest
Made sweeter for the step upon the grass, - 
And view the ground's most gentle dimplement,
(As if God's finger touched but did not press
In making England!) such an up and down
Of verdure, - nothing too much up or down,
A ripple of land; such little hills, the sky
Can stoop to tenderly and the wheatfields climb; 
Such nooks of valleys, lined with orchises,
Fed full of noises by invisible streams; 
And open pastures, where you scarely tell
White daisies from white dew, - at intervals
The mythic oaks and elm-trees standing out
Self-poised upon their prodigy of shade, -
I thought my father's land was worthy too
Of being my Shakespeare's.</i></b>
