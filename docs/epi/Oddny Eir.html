                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Those were fun times in the attic.
I remember how we always plucked twenty or so ptarmigans.
We sang and told stories and laughed our heads off.
But it was most fun after we'd finished and cleaned everything up, 
when, covered in feathers, we'd go out and roll around in the snow.</i></b>
