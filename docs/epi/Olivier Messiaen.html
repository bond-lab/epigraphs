                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>As a muscian I studied rhythm. Rhythm is, in essence, alteration and division. To study alteration and division is to study Time. Time - measured, relative, physiological, psychological - is divided in a thousand ways, of which the most immediate for us is a perpetual conversion of the future into the past. In eternity, these things no longer exist. So many question! I have posed these questions in my Quartet for the End of Time.</i></b>
