                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy instituitions 
But really I am neither for nor against instituitions,
(What indeed have I in common with them? or what with the
destruction of them?)
Only I will establish in the Manhatta and in every city of these 
States inland and seaboard,
And in the fields and woods, and above every keel little or large that 
dents the water,
Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument,
The instituition of the dear love of comrades.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>I Hear it was Charged Against Me</i>,  (1867), Poem, US
