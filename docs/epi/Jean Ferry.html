                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I have started up so vividly impressed by it, that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet room, in the still night. I dream of it sometimes, though at lengthened and uncertain intervals, to this hour. I have an association between it and a stormy wind, or the lightest mention of a sea-shore, as strong as any of which my mind is conscious... As plainly as I behold what happened, I will try to write it down. I do not recall it, but see it done; for it happens again before me.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>David Copperfield, Chapter LV</i>,  (1850), Book, UK
