                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Scientific examination of the spiritual or "occultist" experience demonstrates that haunting can emerge from the forgotten depths of our own past, and assume physical and externalized form, now independent of the memories that spawned it, as Athena sprang from the head of Zeus, of him but at once free of him. Memories and ghosts are not so easily distinguished as previous generations have assumed.</i></b>
