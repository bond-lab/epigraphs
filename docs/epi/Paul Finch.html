                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My son,
When I am gone you will inherit nothing but my bad name, this fur and this sword. Do not underestimate their power. In particular, do not underestimate this sword, for it is the embodiment of our strength. Wield it, and those who come against you will fall like stalks of grass. Do not think this an evil thing, for you will be lord and protector of many lands. While countless will die by your sword, countless others will live by it.
God rules this world and His people thrive, not because He is good but because He is strong. Christians once died like cattle, men, women and children hunted down and put to death in torturous ways. They only came to safety the day they struck back. At the battle of the Milvian Bridge, General Constantine destroyed the pagan horde of the pig Maxentius with blood and iron. This is the only lesson you need learn. The men of the One God rule because they are mightier than those of many gods. Do not be fooled by the wittering of priests and monks. Strength matters. Spare those who oppose you, and they will kill you and your children. This gift of rage I bequeath to you in the form of this sword, which has delivered death to more foes than I can count, and must continue to.
Worship God, serve your overlord, and vanquish your enemies â€” vanquish them utterly. There is no law but your own. God respects those who conquer and triumph in His name. Your enemies are His. Cleanse the world of them.</i></b>
