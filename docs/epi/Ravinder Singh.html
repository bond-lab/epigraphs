                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Days pass by somehow / But nights now are a wagon of pain / Injuries may heal with time / But marks will always remain / Restless on my comfortable bed / I toss and turn and try to sleep / But thoughts are bulking my head / And have formed a huge heap / The past is flashing its scorching light beams / Tearing me apart, breaking me at the seams / The darkness of my life is more visible in dark / And now I am trying to give it a voice, trying to speak my heart</i></b>
