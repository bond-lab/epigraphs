                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>They are going, going, going from the valleys and the hills,
They are leaving far behind them the heathery moor and mountain rills,
All the wealth of hawthorn hedges where the brown thrush sways and thrills.

They are going, shy-eyed cailins, and lads so straight and tall,
From the purple peaks of Kerry, from the crags of wild Imaal,
From the greening plains of Mayo, and the the glens of Donegal.

They are going, going, going, adn we cannot bid them stay, 
Their fields are now the strangers, where the strangers' cattle stray,
Oh! Kathaleen Ni Houlihan, your way's a thorny way.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Passing of the Gael</i>,  (1905), Poem, Ireland
