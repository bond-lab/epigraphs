                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When mathematicians look at crowd behaviour, they see beautiful fractal patterns. In their eyes, we swoop and soar like a murmuration of starlings, all as one. Those who break away from the flock, in pursuit of anomie, go on to create the same recurring shapes elsewhere. Our brains, our lungs and the miles of arteries, veins and capillaries within each of us mirror the natural forms of trees, seashells and tributaries. Even our differences unite us. The beating hearts of Olympic runners and trading-floor bankers, of paediatric surgeons and the innocent under oath are saved by minute irregularities imperceptible to the human ear. Mathematicians know that we are all dancing to the same tune, whatever, whoever and wherever we are.</i></b>
