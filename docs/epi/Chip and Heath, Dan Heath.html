                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has "cursed" us... Reversing the process is as difficult as un-ringing a bell. You can't unlearn what you already know. There are, in fact, only two ways to beat the Curse of Knowledge reliably. The first is not to learn anything. The second is to take your ideas and transform them.</i></b>
