                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Pity it is that the momentary beauties ﬂowing from a harmonious elocntirm cannot. like those of poetry, be their own 1'ecord;—that the animated graces of the Player can live no longer than the instant breath and motion that represent them; or at least can but faintly glimmer through the memory and imperfect attestation of a few surviving spectators.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>If I might give a short hint to an impartial writer, It would be to tell him his fate. If he resolves to venture upon the dangerous precipice of telling unbiassed truth, let him proclaim war with mankind— neither to give nor to take quarter. If he tells the crimes of great men, they fall upon him with the iron hands of the law ; if he tells them of their virtues, when they have any, then the mob attacks him with slander. But if he regards truth, let him expect martyrdom on both sides, and then he may go on fearless; and this is the course I take myself.</i></b>

A soul that pity touch'd, but never shook;

The fierce extremes of good and ill to brook 
Impassive-fearing but the shame of fear- 
stoic of the woods-a man without a tear.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There be, perhaps, who barren hearts avow,
Cold as the rocks on Torneo's hoary brow;
There be, whose loveless wisdom never fail'd,
In self-adoring pride securely mail'd;
But triumph not, ye peace-enamour'd few;
Fire, nature, genius, never dwelt with you!
For you no fancy consecrates the scene,
Where rapture utter'd vows, and wept between;
'Tis your's, unmov'd, to sever and to meet;
No pledge is sacred, and no home is sweet.</i></b>
