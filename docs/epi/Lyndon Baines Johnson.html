                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Worst of all, expansion is eroding the precious and time honoured values of community with neighbors and communion with nature. The loss of these values breeds loneliness and boredom and indifference... once the battle is lost, once our natural splendor is destroyed, it can never be recaptured. And once man can no longer walk with beauty or wonder at nature his spirit will wither and his sustenance be wasted.</i></b>
