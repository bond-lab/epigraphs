                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I am restless. I am athirst for far-away things. 
My soul goes out in a longing to touch the skirt of the dim distance.
O Great Beyond, O the keen call of thy flute!
I forget, I ever forget, that I have no wings to fly,
That I am bound in this spot evermore.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Gardener</i>,  (1915), NULL, India
