The roar of the escaping steam, then heard for the first time at the place where, now, its echoes are unceasing, roused the population, and, late as it was, crowds came rushing to the bank of the river to learn the cause of the unwanted uproar. A letter now before me, written by one of those on board, at the time, records the fact that there were those who insisted that the comet of 1811 had fallen into the Ohio and had produced the hubbub!</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We have been very much alarmed by a repetition of earthquakes since the morning of the 16th of Dec... Various conjectures have arisen in the minds of our readers philosophers as to the causes that may have produced them. some suppose they are occasioned by a volcanic eruption, others seem to think they were produced by the comet's near approach to the earth. There are, however, a few who are of a differing opinion and ascribe it to electricity alone. The latter opinion I have adopted.</i></b>
