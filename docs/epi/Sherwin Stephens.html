                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Don't count on Heaven, or on Hell.
You're dead. That's it. Adieu. Farewell.
Eternity awaits? Oh, sure!
It's Putrefaction and Manure
And unrelenting Rot, Rot, Rot,
As you regress, from Zoo, to Bot.
I'll Grieve, of course,
Departing wife,
Though Greiving's never
Lengthened Life
Or coaxed a sigle extra Breath
Out of a Body touched by Death.</i></b>
