                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Had I the heavensâ€™ embroidered cloths,   
Enwrought with golden and silver light,   
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths   
Of night and light and the half light,   
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;   
I have spread my dreams under your feet;   
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven</i>,  (1899), Poem, Ireland
