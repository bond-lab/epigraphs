                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A grey wolf fell into conversation with a tarantula. ‘I love the
chase,’ the grey wolf said. ‘Myself,’ said the tarantula, ‘I like to
sit here and wait for my prey to come to me.’ ‘Don’t you find
that lonely?’ the wolf asked. ‘I could as soon ask you,’ the tarantula
replied, ‘how it is that you don’t get sick of taking your wife
and kids along on every hunt.’ ‘I am by temperament a family
man,’ the wolf answered. ‘And what is more there is power in
numbers.’
The tarantula paused to crush a passing marmoset then said he
doubted the wolf, for all the help he received, would ever be as
successful a huntsman as he was. The wolf wagered a week’s catch
on his ability to outhunt the tarantula and, returning to his lair,
told his wife and children of the bet.
‘You owe me,’ he told the tarantula when they next met.
‘And your proof ?’
‘Well I expect you to trust my word, but if you don’t, then go
ahead and search the wilderness with your own eyes.’
This the tarantula did, and sure enough discovered that of all
the wolf ’s natural prey not a single creature remained.
‘I salute your efficiency,’ the tarantula said, ‘but it does occur
to me to wonder what you are going to do for sustenance now.’
At this the grey wolf burst into tears. ‘I have had to eat my
wife,’ he admitted. ‘And next week I will start on my children.’
‘And after that?’
‘After that? After that I will have no option but to eat myself.’
Moral: Always leave a little on your plate.</i></b>
