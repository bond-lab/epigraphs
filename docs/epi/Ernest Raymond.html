                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>For all emotions that are tense and strong, And utmost knowledge, I have lived for these— 
Lived deep, and let the lesser things live long, 
The everlasting hills, the lakes, and the trees, 
Who’d give their thousand years to sing this song 
Of Life, and Man’s high sensibilities, 
Which I into the face of Death can sing—
O Death, thou poor and disappointed thing— 

Strike if thou wilt, and soon; strike breast and brow
For I have lived: and thou canst rob me now
Only of some long life that ne’er has been.
The life that I have lived, so full, so keen,
Is mine! I hold it firm beneath thy blow
And, dying, take it with me where I go.</i></b>
