                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I no longer remember what Bakunin said, and it would in any case scarely be possible to reproduce it. His speech was elemental and incandescent -- a raging storm with lightning flashes and thunderclaps, and a roaring of lions. The man was a born speaker made for the revolution. If he had asked his hearers to cut each other's throats, they would have cheerfully obeyed him.</i></b>
