                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>All of us, carers and cared for, are on a journey whose destination we understand only dimly:

We know we are searching for something yet the nature of the thing we seek eludes us. On this strange journey, in this tantalising search, we often feel lonely and bemused, in need of guidance, encouragement, companionship. Not always knowing what we are asking we reach out for the help of others.</i></b>
