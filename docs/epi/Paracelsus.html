                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>...Bearing aloft another Ganymede 
On pinions imped, as 't were, but not past bearing, 
Nor unfit yet for the fowler's purposes; 
Feathered, in short, as a prince o' th'air – no moorgame. 
If Paracelsus weighs that jot, this tittle, 
God knows your atomy were ponderable – 
(Love weighing t'other pan down!) ... 
... in a word, 
In half a word's space, – let's say, ere you flinched,
Or Paracelsus wove one of those thoughts,
Lighter than lad's-love, delicate as death,
I'd draft you thither.</i></b>
