                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Lovers call again to their minds old gentleness and old service, and many kind deeds that were forgotten by negligience. For like as winter rasure doth always arase and deface grene summer, so fareth it by unstable love in man and woman. For in many persons there is no stability; for we may see all day, for a little blast of winter's rasure, anon we shall deface and lay apart true love for little or nought, that cost much think; this is no wisdom nor stability, but it is feebleness of nature and great disworshop, whomsoever useth this</i></b>
