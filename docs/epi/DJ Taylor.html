<li>IN: <i>At the Chime of a City Clock</i> (2010) Fiction, British
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A city freeze
Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper
A city drought, you're down and out
See your trousers don't taper
Saddle up
Kick your feet
Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again

And at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang unto your crown
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to a city man
Who leaves his armous down.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>"Chime of the City Clock"</i>,  (1971), Song, UK
