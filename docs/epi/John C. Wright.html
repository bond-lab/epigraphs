                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,
Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.
Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade, 
Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.
Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime
With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time.</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>The Judge of Ages</i> (2014) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Far along the worldwide whisper of the southwind rushing warm, 
With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunder-storm;
Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.
There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,
And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapped in universal law.</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>The Hermetic Millennia</i> (2012) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;
Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be. -

Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,
Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly bales;

Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain;d a ghastly dew
From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue.</i></b>
