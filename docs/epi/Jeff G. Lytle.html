                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Here. I want you to have this.
It's an opening, and you're welcome.
It's a city, and in the palm of the city
is a lake. In the heart of the lake is a wing.
All the people, all the exhaust & sprawl:
it's perfect. Let them sleep in you
when you sleep. And wake with you,
that you might know them and their streets,
and the light that makes them fall in love,
the light that has always been your light.</i></b>
