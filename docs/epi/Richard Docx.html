                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The term kamatsiri, "dead spirit," is virtually synonymous with the word kamagarine, "evil spirit." Both are derived from the root - kama-, "to die." The word kamatsiri is a noun made from the intransitive form, "the one who as died," while kamagarine is derived from the transitive form, "the one who kills." The two are used almost interchangeably, and both connote sinister and dangerous beings.</i></b>
