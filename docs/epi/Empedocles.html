                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I shall speak a double truth; at times
one alone comes into being;
at other times out of one several things grow. 
Double is the birth of mortal things and double their demise.
For the coming together of all both causes their birth
and destroys them; and separation nurtured in their being
makes them fly apart. These things never stop changing
throughout, at times coming together through Amity in one whole, 
at other times being violently separated by Strife.
Thus, on one side, one whole is formed out of many,
and then again, wrenched from each other, they make up many out of one.
Thus they come into being and their life is not long their own, 
but insofar as they never stop changing throughout
insofar they are forever immovable in a circle. 
But come, listen to my words, for knowledge makes the mind grow.
As I said once before, revealing the outer limits of my thought, 
I shall speak a double truth; at times one has grown out of many, 
at other times many grow apart out of the one, 
fire and water and earth and the immeasurable heghts of air. 
Then dire Strife stands away from all, while Love
reigns in their midst, equal in length and breadth.</i></b>
