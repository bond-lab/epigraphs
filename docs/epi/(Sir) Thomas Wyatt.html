                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>So freely wooed, so dearly bought,
So soon a queen, so soon low brought,
Hath not been seen, could not be thought.
O! What is Fortune?

As slippery as ice, as fleeting as snow,
Like unto dice that a man doth throw,
Until it arises he shall not know
What shall be his fortune!

They did her conduct to a tower of stone,
Wherein she would wail and lament alone,
And condemned be, for help there was none.
Lo! Such was her fortune.</i></b>
