                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"Families are forever" isn't a promise. 
It's a threat.
A gag order.
A lock on a door with one key.
Families will be together because we belong to one another.
I believe in a God of big tents and open doors,
A God present at the first and last gasps of life.
Family is who we choose and whom we mourn.
God does not hold families hostage.
If there is a sealing power on earth, it is love -- 
The messy, patient, inconvenient kind of love
The dirt under fingernails, spitup in hair, cool hands on
fevered brow kind of love
The boisterous exuberant dandelion-flowers-
rammed-into-a-vase kind of love,
The love that witnesses
The love that waits
The love that doesn't ask questions
The love that asks the right questions 
The love that shows up tired, but shows up - relentless love
God is a God of that kind of love.
Families are forever because we carve them together,
Build a home inside ourselves for them of clay and sticks,
Feather them with kind words and apologies.
They are as strong and as fragile as life itself.
Family keeps out the cold.
Family isn't binary,
In or out of the circle.
Family is the circle .</i></b>
