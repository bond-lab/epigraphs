                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>So there is only one thing for the lover to do. He must house his love within himself as best he can; he must create for himself a whole new inward world -- a world of intense and strange, complete in himself. Let it be added that this lover about whom we speak need not necessarily be a young man saving for a wedding ring -- this lover can be man, woman, child, or indeed any human creature on this earth.</i></b>
