                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
bless thy little lamb tonight;
through the darkness be thou near me,
keep me safe till morning light.
Through this day thy hand has led me,
and I thank thee for thy care;
thou hast warmed me, clothed and fed me,
listen to my evening prayer.
Let my sins be all forgiven,
bless the friends I love so well;
take me, when I die, to heaven,
happy there with thee to dwell.</i></b>
