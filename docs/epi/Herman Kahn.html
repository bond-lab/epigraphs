                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Obviously it is difficult not to sympathize with those European and American audiences who, when shown films of fighter-bomber pilots viably exhilarated by successful napalm bombing runs on Viet-Cong targets, react with horror and disgust. Yet, it is unreasonable to expect the U.S. Government to obtain pilots who are so appalled by the damage they may be doing that they cannot carry out their missions or become excessively depressed or guilt-ridden.</i></b>
