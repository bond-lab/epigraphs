                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Though distant every hand to guide, Nor skill’d on life’s tempestuous tide, If once her feeble bark recede Or deviate from the course decreed, In vain she seeks the friendless shore, Her swifter folly ﬁles before; - The circling ports against her close, And shut the wanderer from repose, - Till, by conﬂicling woes oppress‘d, Her fouudering pinnace sinks to rest.</i></b>
