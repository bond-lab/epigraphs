                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Are you surprised that the end of the world is upon us? You might rather be surprised that the world has grown so old. The world is like a man; he is born, he grows up, he ages and he diesâ€¦ In old age a man is filled with complaints in the old age the world, too, is filled with troubles... Christ says to you, "The world is passing away, the world is old, the world is going under, the world is already gasping with the breathing of old age, but be not afraid, your youth shall be renewed like the eagle's."</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Sermon 81, Paragraph 8</i>,  (None), Religious Text, Algeria
