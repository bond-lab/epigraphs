                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles... The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again... but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasims, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Man In The Arena</i>,  (1910), Speech, US
