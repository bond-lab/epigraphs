                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk, 
Though my own red roses there may blow;
It is little I repair tot he matches of the Southron folk, 
Though the red roses crest the caps, I know.
For the field is full of shades as I near the shadowy coast,
And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,
And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host
As the run-stealers flicker to and fro,
To and fro: -- 
O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!</i></b>
