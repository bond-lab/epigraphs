                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Destructive memories frequently stem from repressed unresolved anger about emotional hurts in the past ... The healing of memories does not erase the memories, indeed it commonly serves to bring them into consciousness, but their meaning is changed and their sting withdrawn.

We know we are searching for something yet the nature of the thing we seek eludes us. On this strange journey, in this tantalising search, we often feel lonely and bemused, in need of guidance, encouragement, companionship. Not always knowing what we are asking we reach out for the help of others.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In our bewildered, painful, often despairing world there is still the presence of one who comes, who calls, who gives life and light and healing, who is revealed to us in the simplicity of childhood and in the awful desolation of suffering. And as of old, those who respond to his call and allow him to expand their own horizons of meaning, discover in experience who he is.</i></b>
