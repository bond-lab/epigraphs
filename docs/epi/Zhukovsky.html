                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Over the rough road steeds go racing, 
Trampling the deep snow...
There to one side is God's church
Standing all alone.
........................................
Suddenly a blizzard fills the air;
Snow falls thick and heavy;
A black raven, a whistling wing,
Hovers above the sledge;
Its prophetic cry gives voice to sorrow!
The steeds go dashing on
Peering into the darkling distance;
Their manes fly in the wind...</i></b>
