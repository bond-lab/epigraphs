                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The madman has entered our house with violence
Defiling our sacred grounds
Claiming the single truth of the universe
Bending down our high priests with iron
Ah! yes the children, 
Who walked on our Forefathers' graves
Shall be stricken with madness.
They shall grow the fangs of the lizard
They shall devour each other before our eyes
And by ancient command
It is forbidden to stop them!</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Progress</i>,  (None), Poem, South Africa
