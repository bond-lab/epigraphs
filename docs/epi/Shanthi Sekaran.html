<li>IN: <i>Lucky Boy</i> (2016) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>But leave me a little love, 
A voice to speak to me in the day end, 
A hand to touch me in the dark room 
Breaking the long loneliness. 
In the dusk of day-shapes 
Blurring the sunset, 
One little wandering, western star 
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow. 
Let me go to the window, 
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk 
And wait and know the coming 
Of a little love. </i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>At a Window</i>,  (1914), Poem, US
