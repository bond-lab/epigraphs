<li>IN: <i>Fiery Heart: The First Life of Leigh Hunt</i> (2005) Fiction, NULL
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You will see Hunt--one of those happy souls
Which are the salt of the earth, and without whom
This world would smell like what it is--a tomb;
Who is, what others seem; his room no doubt
Is still adorned with many a cast from Shout,
With graceful flowers tastefully placed about;
And coronals of bay from ribbons hung,
And brighter wreaths in neat disorder flung;
The gifts of the most learned among some dozens
Of female friends, sisters-in-law, and cousins</i></b>

One Lover to another still succeeds; Another, and another after that, And the last Food is welcome as the former; Till having lov'd his Hour out, he gives his Place, And mingles with the Herd that went before him.</i></b>
