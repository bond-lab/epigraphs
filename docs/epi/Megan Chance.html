                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>She left the web, she left the loom;
She made three paces thro' the room,
She saw the water-lily [16] bloom,
She saw the helmet and the plume,
She look'd down to Camelot.
Out flew the web and floated wide;
The mirror crack'd from side to side;
"The curse is come upon me," cried
The Lady of Shalott.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There she weaves by night and day
  A magic web with colours gay.
  She has heard a whisper say,
  A curse is on her if she stay [5]
  To look down to Camelot.
  She knows not what the 'curse' may be,
  And so [6] she weaveth steadily,
  And little other care hath she,
  The Lady of Shalott.

And moving thro' a mirror clear
  That hangs before her all the year,
  Shadows of the world appear...
...
"I am half-sick of shadows," said
The Lady of Shalott</i></b>
