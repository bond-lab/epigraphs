                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I raised my head in horror and saw Lina staring at me with black, glassy, motionless eyes. A smile, between loving and ironic, creased my beloved's lips. I jumped up in desperation and grabbed Lina roughly by the hand.
"What have you done, you wretched woman?"</i></b>
