                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And the meteorite's just what causes the light 
And the meteor's how it's perceived 
And the meteoroid's a bone thrown from the void 
That lies quiet in offering to thee

You came and lay a cold compress upon the mess I'm in 
Threw the window wide and cried, "Amen! Amen! Amen!"</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>Thanks for the Trouble</i> (2016) Fiction, Young Adult Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My love, if you die and I don't - 
let's not give grief an even greater field. 
No expanse is greater than where we live. 

Dust in the wheat, sand in the deserts,
time, wandering water, the vague wind 
swept us like sailing seeds. 
We might not have found one another in time. 

This meadow where we find ourselves, 
O little infinity! we give it back. 
But Love, this love has not ended: 

just as it never had a birth, it has 
no death: it is like a long river, 
only changing lands, and changing lips.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Love Sonnets XVII</i>,  (1959), Poem, Chile
