                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>They say Layla of Iraq is ill,
And ask, "Why, if she's yours, don't you care?"
Allah succours the frail of Iraq
So, too, must I feel for each of the ailing.
For, if Layla's unwell I drown in a sea of the lost
Wandering the land's width and breadth
Without knowing the way to her.</i></b>
