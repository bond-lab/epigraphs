                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Come home! the year has left you old;
  Leave those grey stones; wrap close this shawl
Around you for the night is cold;
  Come home! he will not hear your call.

No sign awaits you here but the beat
  Of tides upon the strand,
The crag's gaunt shadow with gull's feet
  Imprinted on the sand,
And spars and sea-weed strewn
  Under a pale moon.

Come home! he will not hear your call;
Only the night winds answer as they fall
    Along the shore,
    And evermore
Only the sea-shells
  On the grey stones singing,
And the white foam-bells
  Of the North Sea ringing.</i></b>
