                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Heart of the heartless world,
Dear heart, the thought of you
Is the pain at my side, 
The shadow that chills my view.

The wind rises in the evening,
Reminds that autumn is near.
I am afraid to lose you,
I am afraid of my fear.

***

And if bad luck should lay my strength
Into the shallow grave,
Remember all the good you can;
Don't forget my love.</i></b>
