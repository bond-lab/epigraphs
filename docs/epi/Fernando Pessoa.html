                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The man who has criss-crossed every ocean has merely criss-crossed
the monotony of his self. I have criss-crossed more seas than any
man alive. I have seen more mountains than most on this earth.
I have been through more cities than exist and over the mighty
rivers of non-existent worlds which flowed, absolute, under my
contemplative gaze . . .
Did I leave? I could not swear to it. I found myself in other
lands, in other ports, passing through towns which were not this
one, even if neither this one nor that one were towns at all . . .</i></b>
