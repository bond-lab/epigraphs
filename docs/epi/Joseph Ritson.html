                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Fairy Elves
Whose midnight revel, by a forest side, 
Or fountain, some belated peasant sees, 
Or dreams he sees; while over-head the moon 
Sits arbitress, and nearer to the earth 
Wheels her pale course; they, on their mirth and dance 
Intent, with jocund music charm his ear: 
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.</i></b>
