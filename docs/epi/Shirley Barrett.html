                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There are few people, if any, who have not 
heard of the Killer Whales of Twofold Bay --
of the great help they render to the whaling
crews at Eden and the names they bear, such
as Tom, Hooky, Humpy and Cooper ...
And yet those who have known these strange
creatures for a lifetime look upon them as 
friends; yes, just as much friends to the
whaling crews as the cattle dog to the drover;
just about as much, if not a little more so.</i></b>
