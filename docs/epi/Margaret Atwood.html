Who is it tends the Garden,
The Garden oh so green?
’Twas once the finest Garden
That ever has been seen.
And in it God’s dear Creatures
Did swim and fly and play;
But then came greedy Spoilers,
And killed them all away.
And all the Trees that flourished
And gave us wholesome fruit,
By waves of sand are buried,
Both leaf and branch and root.
And all the shining Water
Is turned to slime and mire,
And all the feathered Birds so bright
Have ceased their joyful choir.
Oh Garden, oh my Garden,
I’ll mourn forevermore
Until the Gardeners arise,
And you to Life restore.</i></b>
