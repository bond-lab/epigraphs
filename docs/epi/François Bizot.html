                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I think we should maybe have the courage to identify ourselves with and humanize the torturer. Maybe we should look at ourselves, instead of saying "never again," which does not work. We could maybe try to ask a new question, as well as a very old one: "How is it possible?" We may find the answers in ourselves.</i></b>
