                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Anna Anderson is part of a much deeper mystery than any of us can comprehend, for she left behind so many unanswered questions. One of the most startling question is this: how could a supposedly simple, deranged peasant woman manage to confound the world's  brightest and most respected legal and investigative minds for over six decades? In this regard, I'm reminded of a saying that I once heard: "There are always three sides to every story. There's your side, there's my side. And then there's the truth."</i></b>
