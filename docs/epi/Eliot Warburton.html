And the wind blows fair and free,
The health that we drank to the Outward-bound
Will come back to their memory.

Old friends will still seem near them,
In their ocean-cradled sleep;
And that dreaming thought will cheer them,
Far away on the lonely deep.

Then fill, while the mid-watch passes,
Fill, the toast let it circle round,
From full hearts and brimming glasses,
And, hurrah! for the Outward-bound!</i></b>

That whispered through the palms, or idly played
With the lithe flag aloft-a forest scene
On either side drew its slope line of green,
And hung the water's edge with shade.
Above thy woods, Memphis, pyramids pale
Peered as we passed; and Nile's soft azure hue,
Gleaming 'mid the gray desert, met the view;
Where hung at intervals the scarce seen sail.
Oh! were this little boat to us the world,
As thus we wandered far from sounds of care,
Circled with friends, and gentle maidens fair,
While southern airs the waving pennant curled,
How sweet were life's long voyage, till in peace
We gained that haven still, where all things cease!</i></b>

And hear the fruitful stream lapsing along,
'Twixt villages, and think how we shall take
Our own calm journey on, for human sake.</i></b>
