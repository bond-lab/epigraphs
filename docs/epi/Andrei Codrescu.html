The brass oarsman who bears a tablet of lead inscribed with talismanic characters on his breast and who rows the Third Dervish to the Island of Safety; the little manikin which a dervish fashions out of beeswax and which plunges into the river to retrieve the sultan's lost signet ring; the air-driven statues which seem to speak... and the Ebony Horse, which is powered by wind and, when the right lever is pulled, carries a man through the air: they all simulate life, but there is no life in them.</i></b>

"For", said he, "there never was nor is there one chaste woman upon the face of the earth.".... On this wise he continued for the space of three years; marrying a maiden every night and killing her the next morning, till folk raised an outcry against him and cursed him, praying Allah utterly to destroy him and his rule; and women made an uproar and mothers wept till there remained not in the city a young person fit for carnal copulation.... His Chief Wazir, the same who was charged with the executions... had two daughters, Sharazad and Dunyazad hight, of whom the elder had perused the books, annals, and legends... and the stories... perused the works of the poets and knew them by heart... Thereupon said she, "By Allah, O my father, how long shall this slaughter of women endure?... I wish thou wouldst give me in marriage to this King Shahryar; either I shall live or I shall be a ransom for the virgin daughters of Moslems and the cause of their deliverance from his hands and thine."</i></b>

HE cursed the history that had imprisoned him in his story, he cursed his weakness, the cowardice of his subjects, the flaws inherent to being human, adn the gods who may or may not have been in control of Narrative.Then he entered Sheherazade and it was like entering another story. No, Sharyar corrected himself, it was another story. Sheherazade opened to him the first of a thousand and one nights, she was the crossroads at which it was possible to take another path. It was possible to live again. The crossroads in his bed invited him to take the less traveled road, nay, the untraveled road. Sharyar took it, and Sheherazade remained a virgin (the first night).</i></b>

You play members of the Sultan's Court, whiling away the sultry nights by telling pointed stories to advance your own ambitions. Navigate the social maze and you could win your heart's desire; offend the wrong person and you suffer the Sultan's wrath. Is it a wonder those here turn to tales of mystery and magic, beauty and bold adventure, to fly away in thought, if only for a time? And, if one's tale is well told, and brings one favor of one kind or another, so much the better, is it not so? Gather three or more players; more than six become unwieldy. Give each a pencil and a character sheet or a small piece of paper. In the middle of the table, put a bowl, pleasing to look at, and filled with dice of many colors, shapes and sizes. These are the gems of the Sultan.</i></b>

Only one of them said that she had tried, but being a Christian, she found it hard to read "lies". I said that these "lies" were called "fiction," and that they were stories that most people on earth enjoyed even if they were made up. "When did lies become respectable?" she bristled. "When people wanted to escape from boredom and maybe from themselves," I said, rather pedantically, "Well, sooner will a camel go through the eye of a needle than a liar into the kingdom of heaven," she misquoted from her religion, and I felt it futile to insist that her religion was itself a myth made up by the writers of the Bible. I didn't want to be mean and, besides, she was cute.</i></b>
