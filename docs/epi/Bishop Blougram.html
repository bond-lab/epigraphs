                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I am the man you see here plain enough: 
Grant I'm a beast, why, beasts must lead beasts' lives! 
Suppose I own at once to tail and claws; 
The tailless man exceeds me: but being tailed 
I'll lash out lion-fashion, and leave apes 
To dock their stump and dress their haunches up, 
My business is not to remake myself, 
But make the absolute best of what God made.

And as this cabin gets upholstery, 
That hutch should rustle with sufficient straw.</i></b>
