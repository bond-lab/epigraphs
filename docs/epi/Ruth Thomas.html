                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When they said the time to hide was mine,
I hid back under a thick grape vine. 

And while I was still for the time to pass,
A little grey thing came out of the grass.

He hopped his way through the melon bed
And sat down close by a cabbage head.

He sat down close where I could see,
And his big still eyes looked hard at me,

His big eyes bursting out of the rim,
And I looked back very hard at him.</i></b>
