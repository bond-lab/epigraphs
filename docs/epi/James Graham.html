                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b> But if no faithless action stain
     Thy true and constant word,
     I’ll make thee famous by my pen,
     And glorious by my sword.

     I’ll serve thee in such noble ways
     As ne’er were known before;
     I’ll deck and crown thy head with bays,
     And love thee more and more.</i></b>
