                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When my occasions took me into France, towards the close of the late reign, the clergy, under all their forms, engaged a considerable part of my curiosity,
They seemed to me, beyond the clerical character, liberal and open; with the hearts of gentlemen, and men of honour. They seemd to me rather a superior class; a sort of men amongst whom you would not be surprised to find a Fenelon.</i></b>
