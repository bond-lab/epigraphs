                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>His mother could for him as cradle set
     Her husband’s rusty iron corselet;
     Whose jangling sound could hush her babe to rest,
     That never plain’d of his uneasy nest;
     Then did he dream of dreary wars at hand,
     And woke, and fought, and won, ere he could stand.</i></b>
