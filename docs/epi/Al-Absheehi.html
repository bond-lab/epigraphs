                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And when, in the course of his journey through the wilderness, Jesus came upon a decaying skull and beseeched God that it should speak, the Lord gave it to utter thus: "I am Balwan bin Hafs, king of Yemen. I lived one thousand years, sired one thousand offspring, deflowered one thousand virgins, defeated one thousand armies, and conquered one thousand cities! But all of this was like a dream, and may he who hears my tale not be deceived by the world." And Jesus, peace be upon him, did so passionately weep that he fainted.</i></b>
