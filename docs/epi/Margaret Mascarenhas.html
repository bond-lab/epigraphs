                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Yellowed membrane, stretched taut,
absorbing the pounding 
Of life's rhythm,

Filtering all experience,
Pores clogged,
hot brown mud of anger.

Splashed with the
Blackness of scars,
Sagging with the 
Weight of accumulated rejection.

Cloth that bandages my emptiness
White,
Stark, drained,
Bleached of all my feelings.

Since when did
Colour go out of fashion</i></b>
