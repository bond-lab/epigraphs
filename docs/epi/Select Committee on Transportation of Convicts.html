                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Question -- Are there many booksellers' shops?
James Mudie, Esq. -- I should think there are about half-a-dozen in Sydney.
Question -- What kind of books do you see sold in those shops; is the class of books different from what you see sold in booksellers' shops in London?
James Mudie, Esq. -- Inferior certainly; there are many novels, for instance. I have attended what they call book sales myself, and I have always found that books really valueable have sold for much less than they could have cost in England,  and I remember on one occasion there was a regular noise in the room when the Newgate Calendar was put up, and every person said, 'Ah, I shall have that!'
I forget what it brought, but it brought something enormous... Then they are fond of the history of highwaymen or anything of that kind.</i></b>
