                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Rejoice, sweet orphan, though to you
The world have lost its gaudy hue,
And youth's wild hopes, and dizzy mirth
Can never be your lot on earth,
A calmer, purer light is shed
Along the lonely path you tread.
The kindred dead shall hover near,
And whisper in the spirit's ear,
And ease the load and still the strife,
And smooth the ruggedness of life.</i></b>
