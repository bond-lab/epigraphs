                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Was it Laurie Anderson who said that VR would never look real until they learned how to put some dirt in it? 
Singapore's airport, the Changi Airtropolis, seemed to possess no more resolution than some early VPL, world. There was no dirt whatsoever; no muss, no furred fractral edge to things. Outside, the organic, florid as ever in the tropics, had been gardened into brilliant green, and all-too-perfect examples of itself. Only the clouds were feathered with chaos -- weird columnar structures towering above the Strait of China.
The cab driver warned me about littering. He asked where I was from. 
He asked if it was clean there. "Singapore very clean city."
One of those annoying Japanese-style mechanical bells cut in as he exceeded the speed limit, just to remind us both that he was doing it. There seemed to be golf courses on either side of the freeway...
"You come for golf?"
"No."
"Business?"
"Pleasure."
He sucked his teeth. He had his doubts about that one.</i></b>
