                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>They haunt me -- her lutes and her forest;
No beauty on earth I see
But shadowed with that dream recalls
Her loveliness to me:
Still eyes look coldly upon me,
Cold voices whisper and say --
"He is crazed with the spell of far Arabia,
They have stolen his wits away."</i></b>
