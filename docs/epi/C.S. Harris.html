                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day Is crept into the bosom of the sea; And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades That drag the tragic melancholy night; Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings, Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Henry VI</i>,  (1623), Play, UK
