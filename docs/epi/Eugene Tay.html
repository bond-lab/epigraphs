                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When you're little, night time is scary because there are monsters hiding right under the bed. When you get older, the monsters, are different and though you may be older and wiser, you still find yourself scared of the dark. Sleep. It's the easiest thing to do. You just close your eyes. But for so many of us, sleep seems out of our grasp. We don't know how to get it. But once we face our demons and face our fears, night time is not so scary because we realise we aren't all alone in the dark.</i></b>
