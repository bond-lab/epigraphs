                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Can you speak Greek? 
No certainly! Get you gone then, 
And talk of stars, and firmaments, and firedrakes. 
Do you remember who was Adam's schoolmaster, 
And who taught Eve to spin ? She knows all these, 
And will run you all over the world 
As familiar as a fidler.â€” - 
Can you sit seven hours together and say nothing? 
Which she will do, and when she speaks 
Speaks oracles : speaks things that no man 
Understands ; no, nor herself either.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Wild Goose Chase</i>,  (1652), Play, UK
