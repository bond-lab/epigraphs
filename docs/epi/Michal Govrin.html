                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Won't you see that I am carried to you on a sea of death 
Not on the Styx -- that noble river in a marble infereno
No Charon poles the raft
On my cheeks still lie the curls of the brother
In whose death I live
His breath is the wind in my hair

Won't you hear, in our throats' echoes, the silence
The cry that does not relent, does not release -- 
Of the heads
From whose number a hand was left
To knead our lives

Won't you see
Lining up behind our face
The trains that have carried us
On a journey ordained from then and there
Their whistle is our canopy
A pillar of smoke leading us
To the far ends of the wind.</i></b>
