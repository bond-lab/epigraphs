                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Beatles, The, British musical ensemble whose innovations brought unprecedented sophistication to rock music, and who symbolized the personal and political rebellion and search for identity of many adolescents and young adults of the 1960s. Formed in 1960 and dissolved in 1970, the group consisted of four Liverpool-born musicians: George Harrison (1943-2001); John Winston Lennon (1940-80); (James) Paul McCartney (1942-); and, after 1962, Ringo Starr (1940-), whose real name is Richard Starkey and who replaced Peter Best, an original member of the group. From the simple, fresh style of early songs such as "I Want to Hold Your Hand" (1962), the Beatles progressed to innovative, experimental works such as the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), admired for its dramatic unity, haunting harmony and lyrics, asymmetrical musical phrases and rhythms, and integrated use of electronic music techniques and Indian sitar sound.
