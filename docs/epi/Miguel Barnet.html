                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Havana traps you. A Cuban woman seems to walk on air, not on the pavement. A Cuban man the same. We are gifted with fleeting happiness. We don’t expect a death or an accident either. That’s why people are so emotional and cry and shout and stamp their feet if something happens that isn’t part of the daily routine.</i></b>
