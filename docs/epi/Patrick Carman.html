                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When a man has outlived his limit, plunged in age, and the good comrade comes who comes at last to all, not with a wedding song, no singers dancing, the doom of the death god comes like lightning. Always death at the last. Not to be born is best when all is reckoned in. But once a man has seen the light the next best thing by far is to go back, back where he came from quickly as he can. For once his youth slips by, light on the wing, light headed, what mortal blows can he escape? What griefs wonâ€™t stalk his days? Envy and enemies rage in battles, bloodshed, and last of all, despised old age overtakes him. Stripped of power, companions. Stripped of love. The worst this life of pain can offer. Old age, our mate at last.</i></b>
