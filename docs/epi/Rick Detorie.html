                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>An accidental genius is somebody who possesses an awesome talent that happens to be totally useless.
It's like the guy who can solve the Rubik's Cube in ten seconds, or the girl who can multiply huge rows of numbers in her head and come up with the right answer every time. 
And then there's me, who's seen, like a million movies in my life (my dad teaches a film course and brings home tons of DVDs), and if you name any movie I've ever seen, I can tell you the plot, the cast, the director, the studio, and the year it was released.
And that's not all. I can even recall entire scenes and repeat, word for word, big chunks of dialogue. But because most people find it really annoying when I do that, it's a superpower that I tend to keep hidden. 
Most of the time.</i></b>
