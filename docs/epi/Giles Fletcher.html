                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"The garden was carved like a beautiful woman
"Extended and sleeping voluptuously
"And closing the eyelids in open skies:
"The azure fields of the sky were gathered together properly
"In a circle adorned with the flowers of light;
"Irises and round sparks of dew
"Which hung from their azure leaves, appeared
"Like flashing stars sparkling in the evening blue.</i></b>
