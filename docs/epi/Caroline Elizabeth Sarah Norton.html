                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And, oh! when the glad waves foam around,
And the wind blows fair and free,
The health that we drank to the Outward-bound
Will come back to their memory.

Old friends will still seem near them,
In their ocean-cradled sleep;
And that dreaming thought will cheer them,
Far away on the lonely deep.

Then fill, while the mid-watch passes,
Fill, the toast let it circle round,
From full hearts and brimming glasses,
And, hurrah! for the Outward-bound!</i></b>
