                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Empress… seems to me like a child in a fairy tale. The good fairies came, and each of them laid a splendid gift in her cradle; beauty, sweetness, grace… dignity, intelligence and wit. But then came the bad fairy and said, “I see that everything has been given you, but I will turn these qualities against you and they shall bring you no happiness…. Even your beauty will bring you sorrow and you will never find peace.”</i></b>
