                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>She’s only a bird in a gilded cage, A beautiful sight to see. You may think she is happy and free from care, She’s not, though she seems to be. ’Tis sad when you think of her wasted life For youth cannot mate with age; And her beauty was sold for an old man’s gold, She’s a bird in a gilded cage.</i></b>
