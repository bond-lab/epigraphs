                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Vera said: “Why do you feel you have to turn everything into a story?” So I told her why: Because if I tell the story, I control the version. Because if I tell the story, I can make you laugh, and I would rather have you laugh at me than feel sorry for me. Because if I tell the story, it doesn’t hurt as much. Because if I tell the story, I can get on with it.</i></b>

You can see how it was: Look at the pictures and the cutlery. The music in the piano stool. That vase.</i></b>
