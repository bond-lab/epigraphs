                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We set sail from the Elbe, wind N.E. in the ship called the Jonas-in-the-Whale.... Some say the whale can't open his mouth, but that is a fable.... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains.... I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a barrel of herrings in his belly.... One of our harpooners told me that he caught once a whale in Spitzbergen that was white all over.</i></b>
