                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You shall be my guide, she said, you’ll be my argonaut, with you I’ll go everywhere. I’ll go into the cafés, I’ll jump into the dives, I will enter into the Passages, I’ll go through the oldest sections of the city. I will go into the slums, the two of us will march ahead through the night, forward, until no place remains that has not been trodden under our feet. I shall be your queen, you’ll be my king, I will not be afraid, you will harbor no fear, I’ll have no more nightmarish memories, you’ll have memories no more, I shall be without a past, you’ll be my future, you’ll be without a future, I’ll be your past</i></b>
