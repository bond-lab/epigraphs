<li>IN: <i>Love in the time of Global Warming</i> (2013) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Oh my child, ill-fated beyond all other mortals, 
this is not Persephone, daughter of Zeus, beguiling you,
but it is only what happens when they die, to all mortals.
The sinews no longer hold the flesh and the bones together,
And once the spirit has left the white bones, all the rest
Of the body is made subject to the fire's strong fury,
But the soul flitters out like a dream and flies away.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Odyssey</i>,  (-750), Book, Greece
