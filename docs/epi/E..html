                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Here stood the Indian ehieftain, rejoicing in his glory ! How deep the shade of sadness that rests upon his story: For the white man came with power—like brethren they met But the Indian fires went out, and the Indian sun has set! 
And the chieftain has departed—gone is his hunting ground, And the twanging of the bowstring is a forgotten sound: Where dwelleth yesterday? and where is Echo's cell? Where has the rainbow vanished?—there does the Indian dwell.</i></b>
