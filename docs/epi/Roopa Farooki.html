                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I measure every grief I meet  
With analytic eyes; 
I wonder if it weighs like mine
Or has an easier size... 

The grieved are many, I am told; 
There is the various cause; 
Death is but one and comes but once 
And only nails the eyes.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind... 
For if it see the rudest or the gentlest sight, 
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature, 
The mountain or the sea, the day or night, 
The crow or dove, it shapes them to you feature: 
Incapable of more, replete with you, 
My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate...

Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee...
For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</i></b>
