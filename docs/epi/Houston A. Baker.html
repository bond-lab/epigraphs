                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Blackface is the easiest make-up in the entire make-up box, and requires little or no experience to do acceptably. While any other character requires a great deal of thought, stufy and experimental work, the "nigger" make-up is the most elemental, simple in application and anyone using the least care can achieve a satisfactory result, with little or no practice.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Maroon men throughout the hemisphere developed extraordinary skills in guerilla warfare. To the bewilderment of their European enemies, whose rigid and conventional tactics were learned on the open battlefields of Europe, these highly adaptable and mobile warriors took maximum advantage of local environments, stiking and withdrawing with great rapidity, making extensive use of ambushes to catch their adversaries in crossfire, fighting only when and where they chose, depending on reliable intelligence networkds among nonmaroons (both slave and white settlers) and often communicating by horns.</i></b>
