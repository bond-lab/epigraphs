                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Through we live surrounded by evidence of our own importance... deep down we know that we are merely tiny particles in a vast interconnected chang of life, but for the sake of our immediate survival, we don't focus on that fact... In moments of relaxation, passion, joy, and fear or when we are confronted by death, injury or emergencies, this larger context is suddenly reopened for an instant, like a never healed wound.</i></b>
