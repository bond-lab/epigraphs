                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Mountains are giant, restful, absorbent. You can heave your spirti into a mountain and the mountain will keep it, folded, and not throw it back as some creeks will. The creeks are the world with all its stimulus and beauty; I live there. But the mountains are home.</i></b>
