                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Flight
What creatures these,
Broken and reformed
In nests hanging
By a threat,
Hidden in rusty leaves
Away from predators' eyes?
Do they know 
When spinning silken coffins
That fear of the unknown
And the agony of recreation
Must pay the price
Of precious freedom?</i></b>
