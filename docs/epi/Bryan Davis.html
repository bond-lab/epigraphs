                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Beloved ground that calls for rain, / That cries for flooding wrath beloe; / Consume the priest, restrain the beast, / And raze the land with cleansing flow. // For lions tear the witless prey, / Conspiring prophets fill with dread; / The widows plead, their hearts still bleed, / While prophets' fingers drip with red. // They lie, they steal, they whitewash sin; / Obtaining visions straight from hell. / They rob the poor and shut their door / To strangers seeking ports to dwell. // A gap is torn within your hedge, / The pile of stones you trust to shield; / Protective wall becomes a hall / That channels wrath unless you yield. // I search for souls to seal the gap, / For holy ones to build the frame; O come and stand before the land / Become the stones that block flames. // Alas! No mason could be found / To set the stones the rampart needs; / The flames must rage upon this stage / And purge the land of choking weeds. // A final call I make today, / Will you become the stone that seals? / Will you command and take a stand / And call upon your friends to kneel? // The devil's darts awake to fly; / His priests repel the truth with scorn. / Yet still make haste, no time to waste, / For wrath will come upon the morn.</i></b>
