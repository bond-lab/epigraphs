                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I'm sorry, Fred, I didn't mean to frighten you.
It wasn't until I was on my way down,
free-falling, and saw the look on your face
that I realized this was the sort of thing
could make a person's heart stop.
It was just an impulse, Fred -- there I was
on the balcony, thirty feet up,
looked down, saw you, thought there's Fred
and jumped. I was already feeling guilty 
before impacting, ungainly meteorite,
four inches in front of your twisted features.
God, I'm sorry, man. You said something then
but gladly I don't remember what. 
Your words were lost in the screams
as I turned to look up as you had before
and saw the little girl's leap
into space just beyond the clutch
of her mother's fingers. My fault,
my fault, my fault, I thought
in time with her giddy plunge. I'll never
forget the sound of her femurs shattering.
But it's okay, Fred, it was just a dream,
a stupid dream of unpremediated acts,
falling bodies, and pointless guilt.
It has nothing to do with real life,
nothing to do with us at all.</i></b>
