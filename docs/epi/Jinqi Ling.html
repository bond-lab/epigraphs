                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The hegemonic subject cannot have a terrain of constitution different from the structure to which it belongs... [This structure] is inhabited by an original lack, by a radical undecidability that needs to be constantly superseded by acts of decision. These acts are, precisely, what constitute the subject, who can only exist as a will of constitution external to the structure but is the result of the failure of the structure to constitute itself, it can be formed only through acts of identification.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>To keep alive a sense of alternative ways of life and of struggle requires memory of those who prefigured such life and struggle in the past. In this sense, tradition is to be associated not solely with ignorance and intolreance, prejudice and parochialism, dogmatism and docility. Rather, tradition is also to be identified with insight and intelligence, rationality and resistance, critique and contestation.</i></b>
