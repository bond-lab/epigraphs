                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Ever the wonder waxeth more and more, 
So that we say, * All this hath been before
All this hath been, I know not when or 

where' 
So,friend, when first I look'd upon your face, 
Our thought gave answer each to each, so true
Opposed mirrors each reflecting each â€” 
That tho' I knew not in what time or place, 
Methought that I had often met with you, 
And either lived in cither's heart and speech. </i></b>
