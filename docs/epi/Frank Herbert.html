But there were, after all, a man born Paul Atrides and a woman born Alia. Their flesh was subject to space and time.And even through their oracular powers placed them beyond the usual limits of time and space, they came from human stock. They experienced real events which left real traces upon a real universe.To understand them, it must be seen that their catastrophe was the catastrophe of all mankind. This work is dedicated, then, not to Muad'dib or his sister, but to their heirs -- to all of us</i></b>
