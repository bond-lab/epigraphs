                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A slavery beyond enduring,
But that 'tis of their own procuriug. 
As spiders never seek the fly,
But leave him of himself t' apply;
So men are by themselves employed,
To guit thefteedotn they enjoyed,
And run their necks into a noose,
They *d break 'em after to break loose.</i></b>
