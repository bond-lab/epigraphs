                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>She looked over his shoulder
For vines and olive trees,
Marble well-governed citites
And ships upon untamed seas,
But there on the shining metal
His hands had put instead
An artificial wilderness
And a sky like lead.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>"The Shield of Achilles"</i>,  (1952), Poem, US/England
