                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>One of our favourite boutiques in Gemmayze, this is a meeting point for the creativity thriving in Lebanon. It brings together exclusive collections by eighty local designers. The clientele already includes models, television stars and singers. Now we're told that Hanna Mehdi, daughter of Mateen Mehdi, the former boss of IBCD, has become a big fan too.
The father and daughter are reputed to be worth tens of millions of dollars and have been living in the nearby Saint-Michel hotel since the bank collapsed in 2006. Our girl in the know says Hanna made a whirlwind tour of the boutique last week and walked away with stunning pieces by some of Lebanon's best up-and-coming designers, including some very revealing swimwear.
Summer is just around the corner and it seems that Hanna for one intends to enjoy it in style.</i></b>
