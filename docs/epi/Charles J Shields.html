                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Kurt will have the last word, if not the last laugh - and we will miss that laugh! That ineffable, smoke-laden, sardonically elated laughter that suffused and punctuated his conversation. Laughter that at times seemed inappropriate following the retelling of some of the most ghastly events of the twentieth century. THis laughter was a mental bulwark against the madness of war he witnessed.</i></b>
