                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Vouchsafe, O Lord,
To keep us this night without sin. 

O Lord, have mercy upon us,
Have mercy upon us.

O Lord, let thy mercy be upon us:
As our trust is in thee.

Turn us again, thou God of hosts:
Show the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.

O Lord, hear our prayer:
And let our cry come unto thee.

The Lord be with you;
And with thy spirit.

Let us pray.

Give us light in the night season we beseech thee, O Lord,
and grant that what we sing and say with our lips we may believe in 
our hearts
and what we believe in our hearts we may show forth in our daily life 
through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.</i></b>
