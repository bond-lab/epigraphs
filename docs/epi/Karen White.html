<li>IN: <i>The Beach Trees</i> (2011) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When I have seen by Time’s fell hand defaced 
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age; 
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed, 
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage; 
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain 
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore, 
And the firm soil win of the watery main, 
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store; 
When I have seen such interchange of state, 
Or state itself confounded to decay; 
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate, 
That Time will come and take my love away. 
This thought is as a death, which cannot choose 
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.</i></b>
