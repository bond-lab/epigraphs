                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Beast is an animal
You'd better lock the Gare 
Or when it's dark. It comes for you 
Then it will be too late 

The Beast is an animal 
Hear it scratch upon your door 
IT sucks your soul then licks the bowl 
And sniffs around for more 

The Beast is an animal 
It has a pointy chin 
It eats you while you sleep at night 
Leaves nothing but your skin</i></b>
