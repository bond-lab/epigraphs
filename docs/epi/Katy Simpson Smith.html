                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There is a land of pure delight
Where saints immortal reign;
Infinite day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.

There everlasting spring abides,
And never-withering flowers;
Death like a narrow sea divides
This heavenly land from ours...

Bu timorous mortals start and shrink
To cross this narrow sea,
And linger shivering on the brink,
And fear to launch away...

Could we but climb where Moses stood
And view the landscape o'er,
Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,
Should fright us from the shore.</i></b>
