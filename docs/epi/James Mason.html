                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Ruy-Lopez is more popular than any other king pawn openingâ€¦. The Gambit is astonishingly complicated, embodying as it does a perpetual intertwining of grandiose strategical planning with an alarming maze of difficult tactical finesses and combinative motifs. It is no exaggeration to affirm that mastery of the Spanish Gambit is a requisite for anyone aspiring to become a strong chess player.</i></b>
