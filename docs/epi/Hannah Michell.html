                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I suppose animals kept in cages, and so scantily fed as to be always upon the verge of famine, await their food as I awaited a letter. Oh! -- to speak truth, and drop that tone of a false calm which long to sustain, outwears nature's endurance -- I underwent in those seven weeks bitter fears and pains, strange inward trials, miserable defections of hope, intolerable encroachments of despair. This last came so near me sometimes that her breath went right through me. I used to feel it like a baleful air or sigh, penetrate deep, and make motion pause at my heart, or proceed only under unspeakable oppression. The letter -- the well-beloved letter -- would not comel and it was all of sweetness in life I had to look for.</i></b>
