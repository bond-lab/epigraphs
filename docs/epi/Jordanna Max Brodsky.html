                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I sing of Artemis, whose shafts are of maiden, gold, who cheers on the hounds, the pure maiden, shooter of stags, who delights in archery, own sister to Apollo. Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow, rejoicing in the chase, and sends out grievous shafts. And whe she is satisfied and has cheered her heart, this huntress hangs up her curved bow and leads the Muses in dance while they sing how neat-ankled Leto bore children supreme among immortals. 
Hail to you, children of Zeus and rich-haired Leto!</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And how many times, goddess, 
did you test your bow? 
First at an elm
Next you shot an oak
And third some wild beast.

And fourth you shot not into a tree
but a city of unjust men, who betray
their guests and themselves with
many wicked deeds. On them
you press your fearsome wrath.</i></b>
