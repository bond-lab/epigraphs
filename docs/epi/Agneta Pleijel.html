                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I see that you live a selfless life. You care for an older person, perhaps your mother, who is unwell. There is something within you that I cannot fully interpret. Perhaps it is in your mind, perhaps it is something outside you? There are other things that I see clearly. You will undertake a long journey, alone. You will meet a dark man. He is in a relationship, and you will have to endure a great sorrow. If you do this, the man will seek you out. You will be happy, and you will have two sons. You will die in a white palace, by running water.</i></b>
