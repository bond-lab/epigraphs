                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I asked my boys to search and sort the flints in the spoil heap by the mine. They had high hopes of finding implements, a broken arrow-head at least. All they found, in fact, was the skeletal lower arm of a child. Marks on the hinge joint of the ulna suggested that it had been removed by surgery of some kind. We sent the bones across to Carter for some tests -- and then we entertained ourselves that night, in the darkness of our tents, inventing reasons why the arm was there, and what the fate had been of that child's other bones.</i></b>
