                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When Mama lay a-dyin' on the flatbed,
She told me not to truck with girls like you;
But I was blinded by the glare of your headlights,
And went joy-ridin' just for the view. 

CHORUS: You're a detour on the highway to heaven
I am lost on the backroads of sin,
I have got to get back to the four-lane,
So that I can see Mama again. 

Your curves made me lose my direction,
My hands from the steering whell strayed,
But you were just one more roadside attraction,
It's been ten thousand miles since I prayed.

If you ever get out of the fast lane
And get back to that highway above,
I'll be waiting for you at the tollbooth,
In that land where all roads end in love.</i></b>
