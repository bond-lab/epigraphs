                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>For myself, I cannot live without my art. But I have never placed it above everything. If, on the other hand, I need it, it is because it cannot be separated from my fellow men, and it allows me to live, such as I am, on one level with them. It is a means of stirring the greatest number of people by offering them a privileged picture of common joys and sufferings. It obliges the artist not to keep himself apart; it subjects him to the most humble and the most universal truth.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Nobel Banquet Speech</i>,  (1957), Speech, France
