                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Came summer like a flood, did never greediest gardeneer
Make blossoms flusher: 
Sunday meant lakes for many, a browner body,
Beauty from burning: 
Far out in the water two heads discussed the position, 
Out of the reeds like a fowl jumped the undressed German, 
And Stephen signalled from the sand dunes like a wooden madman 
'Destroy this temple.' 
It did fall. The quick hare died to the hounds' hot breathing, 
The Jewes fled Southwards</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>first of Six Odes</i>,  (1932), Poem, England/US
