                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Left by his friend to breakfast alone on the white 
Italian shore, his Terrible Demon arose 
Over his shoulder; he wept to himself in the night, 
A dirty landscape-painter who hated his nose. 

The legions of cruel inquisitive They 
Were so many and big like dogs; he was upset 
By Germans and boats; affection was miles away; 
But guided by tears his successfully reached his Regret. 

How prodigious the welcome was. Flowers took his hat
And bore him off to introduce him to the tongs; 
The demon's false nose made the table laugh; a cat
Soon had him waltzing madly, let him squeeze her hand, 
Words pushed him to the piano to sing comic songs. 

And children swarmed to him like seeders. He became a land.</i></b>
