                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>LAter the real war was unleashed, to be conducted in secret by radio through the U.S. Embassy in Pnom Penh. South Vietname was already a wasteland, deluged by high-explosives, poisons and fire. Mr. Kissinger had said that the dominoes were falling, so now it was the turn of Cambodia and Laos, delivered to the greatest holocaust ever to be visited on the East. It consumed not only the present, but the past; an obliteration of cultures and values as much as physical things. From the ashes that remained no phoenix could ever rise. Not enough survived even to recreate the memory of what the world had lost. </i></b>
