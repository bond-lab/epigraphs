You're dead. That's it. Adieu. Farewell.
Eternity awaits? Oh, sure!
It's Putrefaction and Manure
And unrelenting Rot, Rot, Rot,
As you regress, from Zoo, to Bot.
I'll Grieve, of course,
Departing wife,
Though Greiving's never
Lengthened Life
Or coaxed a sigle extra Breath
Out of a Body touched by Death.</i></b>

For him, the forty days of fasting described in religious texts would not be achievable - except with divine help, of course. History, however, does not record an intervention of that kind, and medicine opposes it.</i></b>

All they found, in fact, was the skeletal lower arm of a child. Marks on the hinge joint of the ulna suggested that it had been removed by surgery of some kind. We sent the bones across to Carter for some tests -- and then we entertained ourselves that night, in the darkness of our tents, inventing reasons why the arm was there, and what the fate had been of that child's other bones.</i></b>
