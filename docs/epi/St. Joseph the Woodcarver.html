                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>O my Lord God almighty and everlasting, grant me a prayerful heart. Even in the tumult of prosperity and all ordinary distress, give me words to address to Thee, O great Attender to misfortune, and when my spirit is defeated and my faith is an ash pit, yet grant me a silent prayer, O Merciful, O Giver of Life and Creator of this day, this piece of wood.</i></b>
