                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Whenever a butterfly,
happened to fold
too violently its wings -- 
there was a call: silence, please!

As soon as one feather
of a startled bird
jostled against a ray -- 
there was a call: silence, please!

In that way were taught
how to walk without noise
the elephant on his drum,
man on his earth.

The trees were rising
mute above the fields
as rises the hair
of the horror-stricken.</i></b>
