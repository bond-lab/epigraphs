                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The mass and majesty of this world, all
     That carries weight and always weighs the same
Lay in the hands of others; they were small
     And could not hope for help and no help came:
     What their foes liked to do was done, their shame
Was all the worst could wish; they lost their pride
And died as men before their bodies died.
