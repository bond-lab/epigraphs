He found her as she slept in the beauty of her palace. She awakened at the fragrance of the god, which she smelled in the presence of his majesty. He went to her immediately. He imposed his desire upon her; he caused that she should see him in the form of a god. When he came before her, she rejoiced at the sight of his beauty. His love passed into her limbs, which the fragrance of the god flooded; his fragrance was of the land of Punt.</i></b>
