                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I would say to them as they shook in their fear,
   "Now what is your paltry book,
Or the Phidian touch of the chisel's point,
   That can make the marble look,
To this monster of ours, that for ages lay
   In the depths of the dreaming earth,
Till we brought him out with a cheer and a shout,
   And hammer'd him into birth?"</i></b>
