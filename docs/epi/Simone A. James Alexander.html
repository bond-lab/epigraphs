                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>They're treating my resistance to their diagnosis as a personal affront. But it's my body and my life and the goddess knows i'm paying enough for all this, I ought to have a say. I am going to write fire until it comes out of my ears, my eyes, my noseholes - everywhere. Until it's every breath I breathe. I'm going to go out like a fucking meteor!</i></b>
