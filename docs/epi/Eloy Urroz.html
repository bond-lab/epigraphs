                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>So, dare it! Your inheritance, whay you've earned and learned,
The narratives of all your father's voices teaching you, 
All law and custom, names of all the ancient gods,
Forget these things courageously; like newborn babes
Your eyes will open to the godliness of nature...</i></b>

A concrete history of mankind, if there were any, would have to be the history of all men. It would have to be the history of all human hopes, struggles, and sufferings. For there is no one man more important than any other. Clearly, this concrete history cannot be written. We must make abstractions, we must neglect, select.
