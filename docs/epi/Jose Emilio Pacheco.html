                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Our textbooks confirmed this:
Mexico, as can be seen on the map,
is shaped like a cornucopia, a horn of plenty...
A future of plenitude and universal well-being was predicted,
without specifying just how it would be achieved. 
Clean cities without injustice, poor people, violence, congestion, or garbage. 
Every family with an ultramodern and aerodynamic (words from that era) house.
No one will want for anything.
Machines will do all the work.
Streets full of trees and fountains,
traveled by silent, nonpolluting vehicles that never collide.
Paradise on earth.
Finally, utopia will have been found.</i></b>
