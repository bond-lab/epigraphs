                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Be like the flowing river,
Silent in the night.
Be not afraid of the dark.
If there are stars in the sky, reflect them back.
If there are clouds in the sky, 
Remember, clouds, like the river, are water,
So, gladly reflect them too,
In your own tranquil depths.</i></b>
