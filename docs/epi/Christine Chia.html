                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Imagine families being torn apart, unrooted, and separated by borders. You may think that this only happened in countries like Korea, Russia and Vietnam, where the separation of powers divided them. But it once happened here, when Singapore left Malaysia on August 9, 1965, after an unstable, short-lived union. On that day, a tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced that Singapore was a sovereign and independent nation, making Singapore the only country in the modern world to gain independence against its own will.</i></b>
