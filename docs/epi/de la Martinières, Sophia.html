                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Unbroke night;
Darkness is the world I know.
Heavy burden;
No lights behind the window glow. 

Softer day;
A hand reached out amidst the gloom.
Touching gently;
Spreading warmth across the room.

Twilight hours;
Shadows ebb and flow from you. 
Secret longing;
Heart grows tender, beats anew.

Unbroken light;
Darkness was the world I knew.
Burning brightly;
Glowing with my love for you.</i></b>
