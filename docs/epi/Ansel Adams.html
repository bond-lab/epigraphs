                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The terms shoot and take are not accidental; they represent an attitude of conquest and appropriation. Only when the photographer grows into perception and creative impulse does the term make define a condition of empathy between the external and the internal events. Stieglitz told me, “When I make a photograph, I make love!”</i></b>
