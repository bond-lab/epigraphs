                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The solitary bone cyst has not yet revealed all its secrets... The SBC still remains mysterious in many of its aspects. At the time of this writing, nobody can predict the occurence modalities of this benign bone tumor. In a similar way, the reality of this tumor-like lesion cannot be precisely described. Alas, solitary bone cyst was supposed to be a lesion in children that disappeared after growth ended. Is it still true since some cases have been reported more recently in adults? This study represents a long follow-up.</i></b>
