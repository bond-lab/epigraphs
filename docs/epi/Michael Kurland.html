                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I am for Broadway when the moon is low
And magic weaves along the fabled street
For I can search for ghosts of long ago
When time was slow and violins were sweet.
And few there are who note the haunted eyes
That hint of dreams too gossamer to last
And few there are when youth and beauty dies
Who bar the benediction of the past...</i></b>
