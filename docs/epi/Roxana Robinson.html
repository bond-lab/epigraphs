                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Adirondacks are a group of mountains in northeastern New York State known for pristine woodlands and spectacular scenery. They occupy 500 to 600 square miles within the counties of Clinton, Essex, Franklin and Hamilton. The mountains consist of... gneiss, intrusive granite, and gabbro, and are geologically related to the Laurentian highlangs of Canada...
The mountains form the water-parting in the landscape between the Hudson and the St. Lawrence Rivers. The region was once covered by the Lawrentian glacier, whose gradual but powerful erosion produced the characteristic features of the area: scores of lakes and ponds, and many picturesque falls and rapids in the streams. It is a region rich in waterways...
As well as scenic appeal, the region is known for its rich and various flora and fauna. Much of the area has been preserved... over 3,000,000 acres have been set aside to form the Adirondack Park... the wildlife within the region is extraordinarily vigorous and multitudinous. The region is heavily forested with spruce, pine and broad-leaved trees. The mountain peaks are usually rounded, and easily scaled. The vistas thus achieved, of mountain, lake and plateau and forest, are almost unequalled in any other part of the United States for scenic grandeur.</i></b>
