                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Nay, are there not moods which shall find no expression unless there be me who dare to mix heaven, hell, purgatory, and faeryland together, or even to set the heads of beasts to the bodies of men, or to thrust the souls of men into the heart of rocks? Let us go forth, the tellers of tales, and seize whatever prey the heart long for, and have no fear. Everything exists, everything is true, and the earth is only a little dust under our feet.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Celtic Twilight</i>,  (1893), Book, Ireland
