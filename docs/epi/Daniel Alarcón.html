                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The spectacle’s externality with respect to the acting subject is demonstrated by the fact that the individual’s own gestures are no longer his own, but rather those of someone else who represents them to him. The spectator feels at home nowhere, for the spectacle is everywhere.</i></b>

And they’ve opened your sides to cover their stench
And they’ve beaten you because you are always stone
And they’ve thrown you to the abyss so as not to hear
your voice of fire
And they’ve wounded you
And they’ve killed you
And so
they’ve abandoned you like an animal
like the king of any desert
except this one</i></b>
