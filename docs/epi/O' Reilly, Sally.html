                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
And frantic-mad with everyone unrest;
My thoughts and my discourse as madman's are
At random from the truth, vainly expressed;
For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright
Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.</i></b>
