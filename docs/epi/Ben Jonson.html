in euery doome, Since wicked CATILINE went out,
And quitted Rome? One while, we thought him innocent;
And, then accus'd The Consul for his malice spent;
And power abus'd. Since, that we heare, he is in armes,
We thinke not so: Yet charge the Consul, with our harmes,
That let him goe. So, in our censure of the state,
We still do wander; And make the carefull magistrate
The marke of slander.</i></b>

 Or have tasted the bag of bee?
 O so white, O so soft, O so sweet is she!</i></b>

All laws, all conscience; tramples on Religion,
And offers violence to Loyalty.</i></b>
