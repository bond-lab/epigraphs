                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>i-Loikop (noun, Maa): murder
Murder can only occur between Maasai. Only when a Maasai kills another Maasai do we speak of murder. Should disputes between Maasai culminate in death, then this establishes a new relationship between the parties involved whereby those responsible for any deaths are referred to as il-oo-ikop: the-ones-who-hurt.</i></b>
