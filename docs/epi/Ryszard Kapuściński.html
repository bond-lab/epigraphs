                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Imagine the monarch Agha Mohammed Khan, who orders the entire population of the city of Kerman murdered or blinded - no exceptions. His praetorians set energetically to work. They line up the inhabitants, slice of the heads of the adults, gouge out the eyes of the children... Later, processions of blinded children leave the city. Some, wandering around in the countryside, lose their way in the desert and die of thirst. Other groups reach inhabited settlements... singing songs about the extermination of the citizens of Kerman...</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And afterward? What happened afterward?... The way that a great experience comes to an end? A melancholy topic, for a revolt is a great experience, an adventure of the heart... But there comes a moment when the mood burns out and everything ends. As a matter of reflex, out of custom, we go on repeating the gestures and the words and want everything to be the way it was yesterday, but we know already -- and the discovery appalls us -- that this yesterday will never again return... We look uncomfortable into each other's eyes, we shy away from conversation, we stop being any use to one another.</i></b>
