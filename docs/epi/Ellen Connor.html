                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>From the great wate, a leader will rise up. He bears no magic and yet those who fly and cast and shift their skins will follow him. 
  From great sorrow a flower blooms in a woman's shape. A lion prowls in her shadow. She may be born again in the beast's mouth. 
  The flower balances between lion and leader, and she must choose. In such days, an island kingdom may found an empire that spans a hundred plus a hundred years. The world holds its breath.</i></b>
