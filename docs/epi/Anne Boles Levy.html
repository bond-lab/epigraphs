                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You see no purpose in travelling among the galaxies and taking their measure, you are content to watch life unfold on planets whose air you will never breathe. I cannot bear such sameness, each eon unfolding as the last. Let me journey, let me stray, let me see how no day on one world shall dawn the same as on another. I am brave enough to face wherever comes, assured that the worst danger is the one yet to come, on a day still several days away. You are content to stand still and remain unnamed. I am not made this way.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The demons have drove me from the stars and would hunt me to the far reaches of the unreachable end of the universe. They take different forms and different names but always pursue the same purpose: to erase my name from existence. Yet I will be here to greet the end when it comes, the dying breath of Creation, the moment between order and chaos, the time when time stops. I will stand on the edge of infinity and say my name. My name is Nothing.</i></b>
