                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Dust Bowl was the darkest moment in the twentieth-century life of the southern plains. The name suggests a place -- a region whose borders are as inexact and shifting as a sand dune. But it was also an event of national, even planetary, significance... the Dust Bowl took only 50 years to accomplish. It cannot be blamed on illiteracy or overpopulation or social disorder. It came about because the culture was operating in precisely the way it was supposed to.</i></b>
