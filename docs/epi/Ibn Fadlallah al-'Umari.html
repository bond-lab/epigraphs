                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Among those owing fealty to the sultan of this kingdom are the peoples of the deserts of gold dust. The heathen savages who live there bring him gold each year, and when the sultan wishes, he seizes them as his slaves. But as the rulers of this kingdom know from experience, no sooner do they conquer one of these cities than the gold begins to dwindle. No sooner do they establish Islam there, and no sooner does the call to prayer go out, than the gold dries up completely. Meanwhile, throughout the neighboring heathen countries, the gold continues to grow and grow.</i></b>
