But nae smile was seen on Kilmeny's face;

As the stillness that lay on the emerant lea, 
Or the mist that sleeps on a waveless sea.

Such beauty bard may never declare, 
For there was no pride nor passion there;

And her cheek the moss-rose in the shower; 
And her voice like the distant melodye 
That floats along the twilight sea. </i></b>
