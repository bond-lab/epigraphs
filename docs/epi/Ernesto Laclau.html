                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The hegemonic subject cannot have a terrain of constitution different from the structure to which it belongs... [This structure] is inhabited by an original lack, by a radical undecidability that needs to be constantly superseded by acts of decision. These acts are, precisely, what constitute the subject, who can only exist as a will of constitution external to the structure but is the result of the failure of the structure to constitute itself, it can be formed only through acts of identification.</i></b>
