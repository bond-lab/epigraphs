                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The light of heaven falls whole and white
And is not shattered into dyes,
The light for ever is morning light;
The hills are verdured pasture-wise;
The angel hosts with freshness go, 
And seek with laughter what to brave; --
And binding all is the hushed snow
Of the far-distant breaking wave.

And from a cliff-top is proclaimed
The gathering of the souls for birth,
The trial by existence named,
The obscuration upon earth.
And the slant spirits trooping by
In streams and cross-counter-streams
Can but give ear to that sweet cry
For its suggestion of what dreams!</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Trial by Existence</i>,  (1960), Poem, US
