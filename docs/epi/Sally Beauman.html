                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn. / A red wing rose in the darkness. / And suddenly, a hare ran across the road. / One of us pointed to it with his hand. // That was long ago. Today, neither of them is alive / Not the hare, nor the man who made the gesture. // O my love, where are they, where are they going . The flash of a hand, streak of movement, rustle of pebbles. / I ask not out of sorrow, but in wonder.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>They thought death was worth it, but I / Have a self to recover, a queen. / Is she dead, is she sleeping? / Where has she been, / With her lion-red body, her wings of glass? // Now she is flying / More terrible than she ever was, red / Scar in the sky, red comet / Over the engine that killed her -- / The mausoleum, the wax house. </i></b>

What would you like me to write? I have hardly got over the first bedazzlement. It is like being thrown, fast asleep, into the middle of a Beethoven symphony...</i></b>
