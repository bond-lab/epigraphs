                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Now, reader, I have told my dream to thee;
See if thou canst interpret it to me,
Or to thyself, or neighbor. But take heed
Of misinterpreting; for that, instead
Of doing good, will but thyself abuse.
By misinterpreting evil issues.
Take heed, also, that thou be not extreme,
In playing with the outside of my dream.
Nor let my figure, or similitude,
Put thee into a laughter or a feud;
Leave this for boys and fools; but as for thee,
Do thou the substance of my matter see.
Put by the curtains; look within my veil;
Turn up my metaphors and do not fail.
There, if thou seekst them, such things to find,
As will be helpful to an honest mind.
What of my dress thou findest there, be bold
To throw away, but yet preserve the gold.
What if my gold be wrapped in ore?
None throws away the apple for the core.
But if thou shalt cast all away as vain,
I know not but 'twill make me dream again.</i></b>
