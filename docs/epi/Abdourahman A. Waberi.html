                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Thank you, my land; for your remotest
Most cruel mist my thanks are due, 
By you possessed, by you unnoticed, 
Unto myself I speak of you.
And in these talks between somnambules
My inmost being hardly knows
If it's my demency that rambles
Or your own melody that grows.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Gift</i>,  (1938), Novel, Russia
