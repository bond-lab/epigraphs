                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We can see [Sicily] from here, the way you can look from the Tuileries across to the Faubourg Saint-Germain; the Strait - my word, it's scarely any wider than that, and yet we are in difficulties over the crossing. Would you believe it? If all we lacked were a good wind, we could do as Agamemnon did, and sacrifice a young maiden. We have more than enough of them, thank God. But there's not a boat to be had, that's the dilemma. One will be coming in, they say; so long as I have hopes of this, never suppose, Madame, that I will cast a single backward glance toward the country where you live, much as I delight in it. Now I want to see the homeland of Persephone, and discover why the Devil took himself a wife in that country.</i></b>
