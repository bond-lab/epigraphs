                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up and out of the sea. The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle… And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear… After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard... After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast - terrfying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left.</i></b>
