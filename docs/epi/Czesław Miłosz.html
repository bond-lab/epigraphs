                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn. / A red wing rose in the darkness. / And suddenly, a hare ran across the road. / One of us pointed to it with his hand. // That was long ago. Today, neither of them is alive / Not the hare, nor the man who made the gesture. // O my love, where are they, where are they going . The flash of a hand, streak of movement, rustle of pebbles. / I ask not out of sorrow, but in wonder.</i></b>
