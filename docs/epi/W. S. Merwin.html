Now that we are sending you to The End
That great god
Tell him 
That we who follow you invented forgiveness
And forgive nothing
...
When you will not see again
The whale calves trying the light
Consider what you will find in the black garden
And its court
The sea cows the Great Auks the gorillas
The irreplaceable hosts ranged countless
And fore-ordaining as stars
Our sacrifices

Join your word to theirs
Tell him
That it is we who are important</i></b>
