                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Nostalgia ( from nostos -- return home, and algia -- longing) is a longing for a home that no longer exists or has never existed. Nostalgia is a sentiment of loss and displacement, but it is also a romance with one's own fantasy. Nostalgic love can only survive in a long-distance relationship. A cinematic image of nostalgia is a double exposure, or a superimposition of two images -- of home, and abroad, past and present, dream and everyday life. The moment we try to force it into a single image, it breaks the frame or burns the surface.</i></b>
