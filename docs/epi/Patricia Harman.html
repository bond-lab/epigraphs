                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Somewhere in Appalachia, there's a small white house with a blue door. In the back, behind the barn, is a graveyard. Two women kneel in the tall yellow grass. 
Under the rock are three babies, two of bone, one of spirit. Thre are fresh graves too, where black and white sleep together, eight in all.
The women have flowers in their hands, bouquets of daisies, yellow mustard, and pink phlox. One of them makes the sign of the cross. One of them can't stop crying.</i></b>
