                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Treason and murder ever kept together
 As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose,
 Working so grossly in a natural cause
 That admiration did not whoop at them: 
 But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
 Wonder to wait on treason and on murder,
 And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
 That wrought upon thee so preposterously
 Hath got the voice in hell for excellence...</i></b>

 Thou Shalt have no other gods before me
 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image
 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain
 Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy
 Honour thy father and mother
 Thou shalt not kill
 Thou shalt not commit adultery
 Thou shalt not steal
 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour
 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Start with an empty canvas Sketch in broad outline the forms of men, women, and children. Dip into the unconsciousness well of your own disowned darkness with a wide brush and strain the strangers with the sinister hue of the shadow. Trace onto the face of the enemy the greed, hatred, carelessness you dare not claim as your own. Obscure the sweet individuality of each face. Erase all hints of the myriad loves, hopes, fears that play through the kaleidoscope of every infinite heart. Twist the smile until it forms the downward arc of cruelty. Strip flesh from bone until only the abstract skeleton of death remains. Exaggerate each feature until man is metamorphasized into beast, vermin, insect. Fill in the background with malignant figures from ancient nightmares – devils, demons, myrmidons of evil. When your icon of the enemy is complete you will be able to kill without guilt, slaughter without shame. The thing you destroy will have become merely an enemy of God, an impediment to the sacred dialectic of history</i></b>
