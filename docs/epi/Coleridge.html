With a woeful agony,
Which forced me to begin my tale,

That agony returns;
And till my ghastly tale is told 
This heart within me burns.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Ere on my bed my limbs I lay, 
It hath not been my use to pray 
With moving lips or bended knees,
But silently, by slow degrees, 
My spirit I to Love compose, 
In humble trust mine eye-lids close, 
With reverential resignation.
No wish conceived, no thought exprest, 
Only a sense of supplication, 
A sense o'er all my soul imprest 
That I am weak, yet not unblest, 
Since in me, round me, everywhere 
Eternal strength and Wisdom are. 

But yester-night I prayed aloud, 
In anguish and in agony, 
Up-starting from the fiendish crowd 
Of shapes and thoughts that tortured me: 
A lurid light, a trampling throng, 
Sense of intolerable wrong, 
And whom I scorned, those only strong:
Thirst of revenge, the powerles will 
Still baffled, and yet burning still! 
Desire with loathing strangely mixed 
On wild or hateful objects fixed. 
Fantastic passions! maddening brawl! 
And shame and terror over all! </i></b>
