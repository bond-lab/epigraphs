                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We talked of pipe-clay -- regulation caps -- 
Long twenty-fours -- short culverins and mortars -- Condemn'd the 'Horse Guards' for a set of raps, 
And cursed our fate at being in such quarters. 
Some smoked, some sighed, and some were heard to snore; 
Some wished themselves five fathoms 'neath the Solway; 
And some did pray -- who never prayed before -- 
That they might get the 'route' for Cork of Galway.</i></b>
