                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I looked in my heart whie the wild swans went over. 
And what did I see I had not seen before? 
Only a question less or a question more; 
Nothing to match the flight of wild birds flying, 
Tiresome heart, forever living and dying, 
House without air, I leave you and lock your door. 
Wild swans, come over the town, come over 
The town again, trailing your legs and crying!</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Wild Swans</i>,  (1921), Poem, US
