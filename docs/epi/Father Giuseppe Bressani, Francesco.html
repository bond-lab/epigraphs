                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The letter is badly written, and quite soiled, because, among other inconveniences, the writer has but one whole finger on his right hand, and can scarcely prevent the paper's being stained by the blood which flows from his yet unhealed wounds. His ink is arquebus powder, and his table the bare earth.</i></b>
