                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
As his corse to the rampart we hurried;
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
O'er the grave where our hero we buried.</i></b>

From the field of his fame fresh and gory;
We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone,
But we left him alone with his glory.</i></b>
