                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Cathbad the Druid doth bind Queen ~~Medb
By vow thus struck with blood and blade 
Birth afore death and death afore birth 
The last shalt rise afore the first

That by fair child of Findabair 
Medb queens shalt rule the tower lair 
Twenty score years and sixty-six days 
Not one more breath shalt they take 

Until such time the beast doth rise 
Of ancient blood and flame green eyes 
And bring to power a queen once more 
Immortal to rule as none afore.</i></b>
