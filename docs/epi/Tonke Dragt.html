                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"The sun goes down in the sea, in the water," said the Fool. "I shall tell my brothers, because they don't know. Or is it a secret?" "There are no more secrets now," said Tiuri, as he walked to the cabin with the Fool. The Fool stopped and wrinkled his brow. "No more secrets?" he said. "They call me the Fool, but I don't believe that there are no more secrets left." Tiuri looked at him with new respect. "Yes," he said. "You're right. I am free to tell my secret now, but of course there are still losts of other secrets. The secrets of the Wild Wood, for instance, and all kinds of other mysteries. Some of them we have never even heard about. And others we shall never understand." "I'm not sure I know what you mean," said the Fool. </i></b>
