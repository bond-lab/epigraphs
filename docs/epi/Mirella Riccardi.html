                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I had always got on well with the Africans and enjoyed their company, but commanding the people on the farm, many of whom had watched us grow up, was different. With the added experience of my safaris behind me, I had begun to understand the code of "birth, copulation and death" by which they lived. Black people are natural, they possess the secret of joy, which is why they can survive the suffering and humiliation inflicted upon them. They are alive physically and emotionally, which makes them easy to live with. What I had not yet learned to deal with was their cunning and natural instinct for self-preservation. </i></b>
