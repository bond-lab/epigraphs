                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It could be said that the orchid imitates the wasp, reproducing its image in a signifying fashion (mimesis, mimicry, lure, etc.)...At the same time, something else entirely is going on: not imitation at all but a capture of code, surplus value of code, an increase in valence, a veritable becoming, a becoming-wasp of the orchid and a becoming-orchid of the wasp.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>A Thousand Plateus</i>,  (1980), Book, France
