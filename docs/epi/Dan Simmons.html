<li>IN: <i>The Terror</i> (2007) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathesome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.</i></b>

Withdraws into its happiness:
The Mind, that Ocean where each kind
Does straight its resemblance find;

Far other Worlds, and other Seas;
Annihilating all that’s made
To a green Thought in a green Shade.</i></b>

If earth Death’s scroll must be—

Which dawns upon the free:
Although a subtler Sphinx renew
Riddles of death Thebes never knew.
Another Athens shall arise,
And to remoter time
Bequeath, like sunset to the skies,
The splendor of its prime;
And leave, if naught so bright may live,
All earth can take or Heaven can give.
