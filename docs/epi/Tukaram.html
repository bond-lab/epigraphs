                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I'm telling you
The truth
O saints.
I've sinned more
Than most.
I can't understand
Why
You find me
Worthy of love.
I am my own
Witness.
So trust
What my conscience tells me.
I have overcome
Nothing.
My fame is based
On mere hearsay.
Much harrowed by
A life full of hardships,
I stalled
Like a stubborn
Bullock,
That's had enough
Of whipping
And twisting of the tail,
While pulling 
A hard plough.
I just dropped out.
And stayed still.</i></b>
