                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars 
Did wander darkling in the eternal space, 
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; 
Morn came and went -- and came, and brought no day, 
And men forgot their passions in the dread
Of this their desolation; and all hearts 
Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light:</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Over hill, over dale, 
Through bush, through brier, 
Over park, over pale, 
Through flood, through fire!
I do wander everywhere, 
Swiftier than the moon's sphere; 
And I serve the Fairy Queen, 
To dew her orbs upon the green; 
The cowslips tall her pensioners be; 
In their gold coats spots you see; 
Those be rubies, fairy favours; 
In those freckles live their savours; 
I must go seek some dewdrops here, 
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.</i></b>
