<li>IN: <i>On such a Full Sea</i> (2014) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affaris of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries. 
On such a full sea are we now afloat,
And we must take the current when it serves
Or lose our ventures.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Julius Caesar</i>,  (1623), Play, UK
