                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>They thought death was worth it, but I / Have a self to recover, a queen. / Is she dead, is she sleeping? / Where has she been, / With her lion-red body, her wings of glass? // Now she is flying / More terrible than she ever was, red / Scar in the sky, red comet / Over the engine that killed her -- / The mausoleum, the wax house. </i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions. / Whatever I see I swallow immediately, / Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike. / I am not cruel, only truthful, / The eye of a little god, four-cornered. / Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall. / It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long / I think it is part of my heart. / But it flickers. / Faces and darkness separate us over and over. / Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me, / Searching my reaches for what she really is. / Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon. / I see her back, and reflect if faithfully. / She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands. / I am important to her. She comes and goes. / Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness. / In me she has drowned a young girl, / and in me an old woman / Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.</i></b>
