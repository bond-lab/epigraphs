                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Now this is the Law of the Jungle, 
as old and as true as the sky;
And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper,
but the Wolf that shall break it must die.
As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk, 
the Law runneth forward and back; 
For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, 
and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Law for the Wolves</i>,  (1895), Poem, UK
