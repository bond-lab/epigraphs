                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>This, Sir is my case! It is the case not merely of that humble institution, it is the case of every college in our Land... of all those great charities founded by the piety of our ancestors to alleviate human misery, and scatter blessings along the pathway of life... Sir, you may destroy this little institution; it is weak, it is in your hands! I know it is one of the lesser lights in the literary horizon of our country. You may put it out! But if you do so, you must carry through your work! You must extinguish, one after another, all those great lights of science which for more than a century have thrown their radiance over our land! 
It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it!</i></b>
