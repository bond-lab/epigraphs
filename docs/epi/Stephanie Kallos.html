                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Truth has nothing to do with words. Truth can be likened to the bright moon in the sky. Words, in this case, can be likened to a finger.

Nothing could matter less than what we call this force... I called God Phil for a long time... Phil is a great name for God.</i></b>
