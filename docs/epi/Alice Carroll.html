                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>`And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'

   `Well! what are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're trying to invent something!'
    `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.
    `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use denying it. </i></b>
