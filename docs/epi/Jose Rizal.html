Not an Andromeda e'en, not an Orestes, my friend?"
"No! there is naught to be seen there but parsons, and syndics of commerce, 
Secretaries perchance, ensigns, and majors of horse."
:But, my good friend, pray tell me, what can such people e'er meet with 
That can be truly called great? -- what that is great can they do?"</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>O masters, lords, and rulers in all lands,
Is this the handiwork you give to God,
This monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched?
How will you ever straighten up this shape-;
Touch it again with immortality;
Give back the upward looking and the light;
Rebuild in it the music and the dream;
Make right the immemorial infamies,
Perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes?

O masters, lords, and rulers in all lands,
How will the future reckon with this man?
How answer his brute question in that hour
When whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world?
How will it be with kingdoms and with kings—
With those who shaped him to the thing he is—
When this dumb terror shall reply to God,
After the silence of the centuries?</i></b>
