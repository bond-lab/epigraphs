                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Said the Lion to the Lioness—“When you are
amber dust—
No more a raging fire like the heat of the Sun
(No liking but all lust)—
Remember still the flowering of the amber blood
and bone,
The rippling of bright muscles like a sea,
Remember the rose-prickles of bright paws
Though we shall mate no more
Till the fire of that sun the heart and the moon-
cold bone are one.”
Said the Skeleton lying upon the sands of
Time—
“The great gold planet that is the mourning heat
of the Sun
Is greater than all gold, more powerful
Than the tawny body of a Lion that fire
consumes
Like all that grows or leaps… so is the heart
More powerful than all dust. Once I was
Hercules
Or Samson, strong as the pillars of the seas:
But the flames of the heart consumed me, and
the mind
Is but a foolish wind.</i></b>
