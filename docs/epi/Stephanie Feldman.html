                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I envy those who enjoy the quiet of the Grave; But Death eludes me, and flies from my embrace... I plunge into the Ocean; The Waves throw me back with abhorence upon the shore: I rush into the fire; The flames recoil at my reproach: I oppose myself to the fury of Banditti; Their swords become blunted, and break against my breast: The hungry Tiger shudders at my approach, and the Alligator flies from a Monster more horrible than itself. God has set his seal upon me, and all his Creatures respect this fatal mark!</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Monk</i>,  (1796), Novel, UK
