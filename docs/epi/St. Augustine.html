                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Credibilium tria sunt genera. Alia sunt quae semper creduntur et numquam intelleguntur: sicut est omnis historia, temporalia et humana gesta percurrens. Alia quae mox, ut creduntur, intelleguntur: sicut sunt omnes rationes humanae, vel de numeris, vel de quibuslibet disciplinis. Tertium, quae primo creduntur, et postea intelleguntur: qualia sunt ea, quae de divinis rebus non possunt intelligi, nisi ab his qui mundo sunt corde.
There are three kinds of credible things: those that are always believed and never understood: such is all history, such are all temporal things and human actions. Those that are understood as soon as they are believed: such are all human reasonings, concerning numbers or any other discipline. Third, those that are believed first and understood afterward: such are those concerning divine things, which can only be comprehended by the clean of heart.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Are you surprised that the end of the world is upon us? You might rather be surprised that the world has grown so old. The world is like a man; he is born, he grows up, he ages and he diesâ€¦ In old age a man is filled with complaints in the old age the world, too, is filled with troubles... Christ says to you, "The world is passing away, the world is old, the world is going under, the world is already gasping with the breathing of old age, but be not afraid, your youth shall be renewed like the eagle's."</i></b>
