<li>IN: <i>The Shadowy Waters</i> (1900) Poetry, Irish
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I walked among the seven woods of Coole,
Shan-walla, where a willow-bordered pond
Gathers the wild duck from the winter dawn ; 
Shady Kyle-dortha ; sunnier Kyle-na-gno
Where many hundred squirrels are as happy
As though they had been hidden by green boughs
Where old age cannot find them ; Pairc-na-lea,
Where hazel and ash and privet blind the paths ;
Dim Pairc-na-carraig, where the wild bees fling
Their sudden fragrances on the green air ;
Dim Pairc-na-tarav, where enchanted eyes 
Have seen immmortal, mild, proud shadows walk ;
Dim Inchy wood, that hides badger and fox
And martin-cat, and borders that old wood
Wise Biddy Early called the wicked wood :
Seven odours, seven murmurs, seven woods.

I had not eyes like those enchanted eyes,
Yet dreamed that beings happier than men
Moved round me in the shadows, and at night
My dreams were cloven by voices and by fires ;
And the images I have woven in this story 
Of Forgael and Dectora and the empty waters
Moved round me in the voices and the fires;
And more I may not write of, for them that cleave
The waters of sleep can make a chattering tongue
Heavy like stone, their wisdom being half silence.

How shall I name you, immortal, mild, proud shadows?
I only know that all we know comes from you,
And that you come from Eden on flying feet.
Is Eden far away, or do you hide
From human thought, as hares and mice and coneys
That run before the reaping-hook and lie
In the last ridge of barley? Do our woods
And winds and ponds cover more quiet woods, 
More shining winds, more star-glimmering ponds?

Is Eden out of time and out of space ?
And do you gather about us when pale light
Shining on water and fallen among leaves,
And winds blowing from flowers, and whirr of feathers
And the green quiet, have uplifted the heart?

I have made this poem for you, that men may read it
Before they read of Forgael and Dectora,
As men in the old times, before the harps began,
Poured out wine for the high invisible ones.</i></b>

it was not. I had a dream one night which gave me a story, and I had certain emotions about this country, and I gave those emotions expression for my own pleasure. If I had written to convince others I
would have asked myself, not ‘Is that exactly what I think and feel?’ but ‘How would that strike so-and-so? How will they think and feel when they have read it?’ And all would be oratorical and insincere. We only understand our own minds, and the things that are striving to utter themselves through our minds, and we move others, not because we have understood or thought about them at all, but because all life has the same root. Coventry Patmore has said, ‘The end of art is peace,’ and the following of art is little different from the following of religion in the intense preoccupation that it demands.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I walked among the seven woods of Coole,
Shan-walla, where a willow-bordered pond
Gathers the wild duck from the winter dawn ; 
Shady Kyle-dortha ; sunnier Kyle-na-gno
Where many hundred squirrels are as happy
As though they had been hidden by green boughs
Where old age cannot find them ; Pairc-na-lea,
Where hazel and ash and privet blind the paths ;
Dim Pairc-na-carraig, where the wild bees fling
Their sudden fragrances on the green air ;
Dim Pairc-na-tarav, where enchanted eyes 
Have seen immmortal, mild, proud shadows walk ;
Dim Inchy wood, that hides badger and fox
And martin-cat, and borders that old wood
Wise Biddy Early called the wicked wood :
Seven odours, seven murmurs, seven woods.

I had not eyes like those enchanted eyes,
Yet dreamed that beings happier than men
Moved round me in the shadows, and at night
My dreams were cloven by voices and by fires ;
And the images I have woven in this story 
Of Forgael and Dectora and the empty waters
Moved round me in the voices and the fires;
And more I may not write of, for them that cleave
The waters of sleep can make a chattering tongue
Heavy like stone, their wisdom being half silence.

How shall I name you, immortal, mild, proud shadows?
I only know that all we know comes from you,
And that you come from Eden on flying feet.
Is Eden far away, or do you hide
From human thought, as hares and mice and coneys
That run before the reaping-hook and lie
In the last ridge of barley? Do our woods
And winds and ponds cover more quiet woods, 
More shining winds, more star-glimmering ponds?

Is Eden out of time and out of space ?
And do you gather about us when pale light
Shining on water and fallen among leaves,
And winds blowing from flowers, and whirr of feathers
And the green quiet, have uplifted the heart?

I have made this poem for you, that men may read it
Before they read of Forgael and Dectora,
As men in the old times, before the harps began,
Poured out wine for the high invisible ones.</i></b>
