                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My bnrthplace vanished, my citizenship earned, 
in league with stones of the earth, I 
enter, without retreat or help from history, 
the days of no day, my earth 
of no earth, I re-enter 

the city in which I love you. 
And I never believed that the multitude 
of dreams and many words were vain.
