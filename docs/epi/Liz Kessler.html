                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>If you come to me
I will receive you with honour, 
with respect and gentleness.

If you come to me 
I will dismiss this life
of mine and take on yours.

If you come to me
in the burning sun as it dips
behind the tree line, 

I will know that it's you 
and keep faith. 
Come soon. Come now.</i></b>
