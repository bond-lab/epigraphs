                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When the green field comes off like a lid,
Revealing what was much better hid -
Unpleasant:
And look, behind you without a sound
The woods have come up and are standing round
In deadly crescent.

The bolt is sliding in its groove;
Outside the window is the black remov-
-ers' van;
And now with sudden swift emergence
Come the hooded women, the hump-backed surgeons,
And the Scissor Man.</i></b>
