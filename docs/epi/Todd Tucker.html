                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The trigger pull of the M6 Scout is a bit stiff for the smallest youngsters, but using four fingers at first, and later two on the unique squeeze bar trigger works well. The gun's accuracy is quite good, too -- a helpful trait in preventing discouragemenet in a young shooter.</i></b>
