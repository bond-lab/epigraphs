                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Minutes nearer Midnight. On which stroke
Powers at the heart of matter, powers
We shall have hacked through thorns to kiss awake,
Will open baleful, sweeping eyes, draw breath
And speak new formulae of megadeath.

Earth wore a strange new zone of energy
Caused by? Smashed atoms of the dead my dears
News that brought into play our deepest fears.</i></b>
