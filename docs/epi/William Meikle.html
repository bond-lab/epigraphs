Plastic pollution: A growing threat to the health of our oceans.
The scale of pollution in all our oceans is vast. The majority of the plastic—80%— comes directly from land. Whales, dolphins, turtles, seals and countless other marine life have become victims of land litter. Marine debris is found floating in all the world’s oceans, even near the Polar Regions. It also contaminates the seabed. It is found everywhere, from the beaches of industrialized countries to the shores of the remotest, uninhabited islands. Because it doesn’t break down, such pollution can linger for years, affecting marine environments far from where it entered the ocean.</i></b>
