                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>How does it happen, tell me,
That I lie here unmarked, forgotten,
While Chase Henry, the town drunkard,
Has a marble block, topped by an urn,
Wherein Nature, in a mood ironical,
Has sown a flowering weed?”</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Over and over, they used to ask me
While buying the wine or the beer…
How I happened to lead the life,
And what was the start of it.
Well, I told them a silk dress,
And a promise of marriage from a rich man…
But that was not really it at all.
Suppose a boy steals an apple
From the tray at the grocery store,
And they all begin to call him a thief,
The editor, minister, judge, and all the people-
“A thief,” “a thief,” “a thief” wherever he goes.
And he can’t get work, and he can’t get bread
Without stealing it, why the boy will steal.
It’s the way the people regard
the theft of the apple
That makes the boy what he is.</i></b>
