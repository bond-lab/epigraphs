                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I have had worse partings, but none that so
Gnaws at my mind still, Perhaps it is roughly
Saying what God alone could perfectly showâ€”
How selfhood begins with a walking away,
And love is proved in the letting go.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Walking Away</i>,  (1962), Poem, Ireland
