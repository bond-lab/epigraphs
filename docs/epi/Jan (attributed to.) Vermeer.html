                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Our task is not to solve enigmas, but to be aware of them, to bow our heads before them and also to prepare the eyes for never-ending delight and wonder. If you absolutely require discoveries, however, I will tell you that I am proud to have succeeded in combining a certain particularly intensive cobalt with a luminous lemonlike yellow, as well as recording the reflection of southern light that strikes through thick glass on to a grey wall... Allow us to continue our archaic procedure, to tell the world words or reconcilliation and to speak of joy from recovered harmony, of the eternal desire for reciprocated love.</i></b>
