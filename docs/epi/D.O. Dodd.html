                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The plague, Like a great fire, if a few houses only are contiguous where it happens, can only burn a few houses;
  or if it begins in a single, or as we call it, a lone house,
  can only burn that lone house where it begins. 
 But if it begins in a close-built town or city and gets a head,
 there its fury increases: it rages over the whole place,
 and consumes all it can reach.</i></b>
