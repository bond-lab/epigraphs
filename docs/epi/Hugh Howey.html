That same year, CBS re-aired a program about the effects of propranolol on sufferers of extreme trauma. A simple pill, it had been discovered, could wipe out the memory of any traumatic event.
At almost the same moment in humanity’s broad history, mankind had discovered the means for bringing about its utter downfall. And the ability to forget it ever happened.</i></b>

In the year of the Great Uprising
Now they lay me in the deep,

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Five links stand out in the chain that binds our will.
There’s the primal urges, wound tight in nucleotidal strands.
There’s the faith that surges through our clasped and superstitious hands.
There’s the politics of kings and queens, and their many rules.
There’s culture which forms mobs of motley fools.
Last comes our decisions, stacked
up in piles of regret
that we long
to forget.
These five links stand out in the chain that binds our will.
They hold us, guide us, coerce us—
And we rattle them still.</i></b>
