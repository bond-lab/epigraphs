                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Some time when the river is ice ask me 
mistakes I have made. Ask me whether 
what I have done is my life. Others
have come in their slow way into 
my thought, and some have tried to help
or to hurt: ask me what difference 
their strongest love or hate has made.

I will listen to what you say.
You and I can turn and look
at the silent river and wait. We know
the current is there, hidden; and there
are comings and goings from miles away
that hold the stillness exactly before us.
What the river says, that is what I say.</i></b>
