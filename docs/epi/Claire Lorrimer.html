                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>From the brake the Nightingale
Sings exulting to the Rose;
Though he sees her waxing pale
In her passionate repose,
While she triumphs waxing frail,
Fading even while she glows;
Though he knows
How it goes -- 
Knows of last year's Nightingale
Dead with last year's Rose...</i></b>
