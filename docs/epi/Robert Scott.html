                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>By this I'd have it understood,
My brains have long been beat with wood;
My arms worn out with driving planes,
I now begin to beat my brains,
To search each crannie there for bread,
Age makes me now give up the trade;
Please buy my book, you'll not repent,
By age you now many learn content.</i></b>
