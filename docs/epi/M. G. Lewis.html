                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>While stranger-eyes, whene'er her form is seen, 
Own her of captive hearts unrivalled Queen ; 
While stranger-ears, catching some passive strain, 
The music of her voice through life retain ; 
Admired by all, with truth she still may boast, 
The few, who know her best, admire her most.</i></b>
