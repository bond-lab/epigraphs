                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>How long, oh gods?
will you forget us for ever?
how long will you hide your faces from us?
How long shall we have perplexity in our minds,
and grief in our hearts, day after day?
how long shall our enemies triumph over us?
Look upon us and answer us, oh gods;
and give light to our eyes, lest we sleep in death,
lest our enemy say, “I have prevailed over them,”
and our foes rejoice that we have fallen.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>"Cry for the missing city", Songs of lamentation -- based on Psalm 13, verses 1-4 from The new Revised Standard Version of the Bible c. 1989</i>,  (1989), Poem, NULL
