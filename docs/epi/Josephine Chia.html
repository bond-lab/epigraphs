                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The world is too much with us: late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
Little we see in Nature that is ours;
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
The Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
The winds that will be howling at all hours
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;
For this, for everything, we are out of tune;
It moves us not.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>"The World is Too much with us"</i>,  (1806), Poem, UK
