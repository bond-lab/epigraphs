                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A house is a simple construct.
The builders die, but it goes on.
And still every childhood matters,
like mint grown in the shade,
all translation is painstaking,
and has no natural melody.
The world may be old,
but even then it was old,
without end or beginning.</i></b>
