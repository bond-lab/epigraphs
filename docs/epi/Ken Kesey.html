                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water 
And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said,All men will be Sailors then
Until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom
Like a stone</i></b>

--written later, on the run, in Mexico:


Down to five pesos from five thousand dollars
Down to the dregs from the lip-smacking foam
Down to a dopefiend from a prizewinning scholar
Down to the bush from a civilized home.

What people once called a promising talent
What used to be known as an upstanding lad
Now hounded and hunted by the law of two countries
And judged to be only a Tarnished Galahad. 

Tarnished Galahad--did your sword get rusted?
Tarnished Galahad--there's no better name! 
Keep running and hiding 'til the next time you're busted
And locked away to suffer your guilt, and shame.</i></b>
