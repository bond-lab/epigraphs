                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My love, if you die and I don't - 
let's not give grief an even greater field. 
No expanse is greater than where we live. 

Dust in the wheat, sand in the deserts,
time, wandering water, the vague wind 
swept us like sailing seeds. 
We might not have found one another in time. 

This meadow where we find ourselves, 
O little infinity! we give it back. 
But Love, this love has not ended: 

just as it never had a birth, it has 
no death: it is like a long river, 
only changing lands, and changing lips.</i></b>
