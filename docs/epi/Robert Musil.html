                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>As soon as we put something into words, in a strange way we devalue it. We think we have dived to the bottom of the abyss, and when we return to the surface the drop of water glistening on our pale fingertips no longer resembles the sea from which it comes. We imagine we have discovered a cave full of wonderful treasures, and when we return to the light of day, we find that all we have brought back is false jewels and shards of glass; and yet the treasure continues to gleam in the dark, unaltered.</i></b>
