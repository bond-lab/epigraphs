I'm not writing my auto-biography, and I'm not writing things as they happen to me, with the exception of the use of details -- thunderstorms and that sort of thing. No, it's nothing that happened to me. It's a possibility. It's an idea.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I had as yet no notion that life every now and then becomes literature -- not for long, of course, but long enough to be what we best remember, and often enough so that what we eventually come to mean by life are those moments when life, instead of going sideways, backwards, forward, or nowhere at all, lines out straight, tense and inevitable, with a complication, climax, and, given some luck, a purgation, as if life had been made and not happened.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>People say it's not what happens in your life that matters, it's what you think happened. But this qualification, obviously, did not go far enough. It was quite possible that the central event in your life could be something that didn't happen, or something you thought  didn't happen. Otherwise there'd be no need for fiction, there'd only be memoirs and histories, case histories; what happened -- what actually happened to you and what you thought happened -- would be enough.</i></b>
