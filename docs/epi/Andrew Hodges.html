                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My dear Norman, 
... I've now got myself into the kind of trouble that I have always considered to be quite a possiblity for me, though I have usually rated it at about 10:1 against... The story of how it all came to be found out is a long and fascinating one, which I shall have to make into a short story one day, but haven't the time to tell you now. No doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out...
Yours in distress, 
Alan</i></b>
