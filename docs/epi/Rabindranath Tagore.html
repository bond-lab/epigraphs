                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And then another problem reared its head. When Miss Gilby had first entered the inner courtyard there had been a great deal of trouble that had lasted quite some time. Eventually, the whole thing had got buried under the routine and rhythms of quotidian life. But soon everything was raked up again; I hadn't given much thought to Miss Gilby's nationality for a long time but now I began to do so. I said to my husband, "I think you should ask her to leave." He kep quiet. I said a lot of unpleasant things to him. He heard me out, silent and sad, and then left the room. I sulked and cried for a while. That night, he said to me, "Bimala, I cannot see Miss Gilby as just an English woman and nothing more. Does the fact that you've known her for so long count as nothing? Is her Englishness everything? Don't you understand how fond she is of you?" 
I felt ashamed but coudn't swallow my pride entirely and agree that he was right. So I said, somewhat petutantly, "All right, then, let her stay. Who's asked her to leave?"</i></b>
