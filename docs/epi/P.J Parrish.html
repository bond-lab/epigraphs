                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>For all the mad housewives who weren’t
The wind doth blow today, my love,
And a few small drops of rain;
I never had but one true-love;
In cold grave she was lain.
I’ll do as much for my true-love
As any young man may;
I’ll sit and mourn all at her grave
For a twelvemonth and a day.
The twelvemonth and a day being up,
The dead began to speak:
‘Oh who sits weeping on my grave,
and will not let me sleep?’

That parchment scribbled o’er should undo a man? Some say, the bee stings: but I say, ’tis the bee’s wax, for I did but seal once to a thing, and I was never mine own man since.</i></b>

To war with evil? Is there any peace
In ever climbing up the climbing wave?

In silence-ripen, fall, and cease:
Give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease.</i></b>
