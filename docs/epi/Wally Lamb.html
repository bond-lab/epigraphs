                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You see a man
trying to think.

You want to say
to everything:
Keep off! Give him room!
But you only watch,
terried
the old consolations
will get him at last
like a fish 
half-dead from flopping
and almost crawling
across the shingle,
almost breathing 
the raw, agonizing 
air
till a wave
pulls it back blind into the triumphant 
sea.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Ghost of a Chance</i>,  (1993), Poem, US
