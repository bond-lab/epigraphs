                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The West Indian or Asian does not, by being born in England, become an Englishman. In law he becomes a United Kingdom citizen by birth; in fact he is a West Indian or an Asian still... he will by the very nature of things have lost one country without gaining another, lost one nationality without acquiring a new one. Time is running out against us and them. With the lapse of a generation or so we shall at last have succeeded -- to the benefit of nobody -- in reproducing "in England's green and pleasant land" the haunting tragedy of the United States.</i></b>
