                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Accursed be the fury of the traitor Julian, of which we were long the victims; accursed be his wrath, for it was cruel and evil; his rage was boundless and his hatred intractable, his madness precocious; he was incapable of loyalty, respected no law of the land, and scorned God; a pitiless man, the murderer of his suzerain, the enemy of his own house, the destroyer of his own land, perfidious and treacherous and guilty of many grave misdeeds against his own people; there is a bitter ring to his name in the mouths of those who utter it; the very memory of him brings pain and sorrow to the heart of anyone who speaks of him, and his name will be forever accursed by all who mention it.</i></b>
