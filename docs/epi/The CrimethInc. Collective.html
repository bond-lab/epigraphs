                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>For what else should we pursue, if not happiness? If something isn't valueable because we find meaning and joy in it, then what could possibly make it important? How could abstractions like "responsiblity," "order," or "propriety" posssibly be more important than the real needs of the people who invented them? Should we serve employers, parents, the State, God, capitalism, moral law, causes, movements, "society" before ourselves? Who taught you that, anyway?</i></b>
