                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Instead of a part of the organism itself, the fossil may be some kind of record of its presence, such as a fossilised track or brrow,,, These fossils give us our only chance to see the extinct animals in action and to study their behavior, though definite identification is only possible where the animal has dropped dead in its tracks and become fossilized on the spot.</i></b>
