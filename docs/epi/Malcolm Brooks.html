                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Beyond Arrow Creek, by the Mission house, the war-drum of Bear-below was beating monotonously, and over in the hay field that belonged to Plenty-coups a white man was mowing grass with that clattering modern mower. Yesterday I had seen an airplane flying over the Chief's house. The past seemed desperately to clash with the present on the Crow reservation.</i></b>
