Of deep-toned bells on the black midnight wind;
Peals from no steeple I could ever find,
But strange, as if across some great void winging.
I searched my dreams and memories for a clue,
And thought of all the chimes my visions carried;
OF quiet Innsmouth, where the white gulls tarried
Around an ancient spire that once I knew.</i></b>
