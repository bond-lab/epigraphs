                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There was a painted bird
Sitting in a green lemon tree,
With its beak it cut the branch,
With the branch it cut the flower,
Ay, ay, at!
When will my love come?

I kneel at the feet of my love,
I get up, loyal, loyal,
Give me your hand, give me the other,
Give me a kiss one the mouth.

I'll make a half turn,
I'll make a full circle,
With one step back,
Making a bow.

But no, but no, but no,
Because I'm embarrased,
But yes, but yes, but yes,
Because I love you.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>La Pajara Pinta (The Painted Bird)</i>,  (None), Song, Cuba
