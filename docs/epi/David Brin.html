                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute
how who
why who
Betwixt damnation and impassion’d clay
Must I burn through …
But when I am consumed in the Fire,
Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Little is known about the final days of Hari Seldon, though many romanticized accounts exist, some of them purportedly by his own hand. None has any proved validity.
What appears evident, however, is that Seldon spent his last months uneventfully, no doubt enjoying satisfaction in his life’s work. For with his gift of mathematical insight, and the powers of psychohistory at his command, he must surely have seen the panorama of history stretching before him, confirming the great path of destiny that he had already mapped out.
Although death would soon claim him, no other mortal ever knew with such confidence and certainty the bright promise that the future would hold in store.</i></b>

in the highest heights, or profound depths.
Yet, marvels are found in shallow sites
where life starts, burgeons, and dies.
What pinnacle, or lofty mount,
offers lessons as poignant
as the flowing river—
a crashing reef—
or the grave?</i></b>
