                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Then van Worden took, from his satchel, a bundle of yellowing mildewed papers tied up with twine, put it on the table. From what Mr Letherbotham could see, the sheets were covered in dense scrawl, mostly in English, but with passages of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and some other languages he didn't recognize. He peered closer, over the top of his glasses.
'Found this yesterday,' van Worden said. 'Clearing out the cellar of the new premises.'
'What is it?'
'An old manuscript. Much of it is hard to make out, but...'
Mr Letherbotham cut in.
'What? That worn-out old Gothic trope?'
He rolled his eyes.</i></b>
