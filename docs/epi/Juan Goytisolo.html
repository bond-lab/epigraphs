                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In their struggle against the Byzantines and the Berbers, the Arab chieftains had greatly extended their African dominions, and as early as the year 682 Uqba had reached the shores of the Atlantic, but he was unable to occupy Tangier, for he was forced to turn back toward the Atlas Mountains by a mysterious person whom Moslem historians almost always refer to as Ulyan, though his real name was problably Julian, or perhaps Urban or Ulban or Bulian. Soon thereafter he became a legendary figure, known as "Count Julian." We are not certain whether he was a Berber, a Visigoth, or a Byzantine; as a "count" he may have been the ruler of the fortress of Septem, once part of the Visigoth kingdom; or he may have been an exarch or a governor ruling in the name of the Byzantine Emperor: or, as he appears more likely, he may have been a Berber who was the lord and master of the Catholic tribe of Gomera...</i></b>
