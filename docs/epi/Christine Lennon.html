                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I could not tell myself the old story Once upon a time because the time was now; the story was now; Iâ€™d believed I was causing the story to take place, but in fact the story was taking place around me, as a tide rises, brackish and muddy and filthy and filled with debris. My Kappa sisters were fascinating to me as giant, brightly feathered predator birds would be fascinating to a small songbird hiding in the brush. Or trying to hide in the brush.</i></b>
