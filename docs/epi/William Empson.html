                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It has been deduced from the belief in Pure Sound that the resultant meaning of the words need not be known, that it is enough to know the meaning of the words in isolation and enough of their syntax to read them aloud rightly. In a degree this is often true, but it is best to regard this state of limited knowledge as a complicated state of indecision which involves much estimating of probabilites, and is less ignorance than an ordered suspension of judgement... a musical chord is a direct sensation, but not therefore unanalyzable into its separate notes even at the moment of sensing. It can be either felt or thought; the two things are similar but different; and it requires practice to do both at once.</i></b>
