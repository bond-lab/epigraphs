                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And then, after a quartet of an hour's conversation, let the lady release the gentlemen from further attendance, by bowing to him, and turning to some other acquaintance who may not be far off. She can leave him much more easily than he can leave her, and it will be better to do so in proper time, than to detain him too long. It is generally in his power to return to her before the close of the evening, and if he is pleased with her society, he will probably make an opportunity of doing so.</i></b>
