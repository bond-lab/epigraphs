                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The preceptions of persons in retirement are very different from those of people in the great world: their passions, being differently modified, are differently expressed; their imaginations, constantly impressed by the same objects, are more violently affected. The same small number of images continually return, mix with every idea, and create those strange and false notions, so remarkable in people who spend their lives in solitude.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Julie; or, The New Heloise</i>,  (1761), Novel, Switzerland
