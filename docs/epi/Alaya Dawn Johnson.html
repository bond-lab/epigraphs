                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It is said that once the back of a fine watch is opened for repair or examination it can never again run in the same way, for a fleck of dust will always lodge invisibly in the works and provide a stress, albeit incalculably small, to the functioning of the mechanism. So too when a drug opens the clockworks of consciousness for examination, that awareness thereafter becomes ever so slightly more self-aware. Self-consciousness becomes a slightly greater part of consciousness. And so the question finally becomes: how intimately do we want or need to know ourselves?</i></b>
