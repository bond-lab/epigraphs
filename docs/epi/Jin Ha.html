                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Alas, after all's been said, I still can't choose a virtuous man as my hero. I can explain why: the virtuous man has been turned into a sort of horse and there's no author who hasn't ridden him, urging him on with his whip or whatever comes to hand. Now I feel the time has come to make use of a rogue. So let's harness him for a change!</i></b>
