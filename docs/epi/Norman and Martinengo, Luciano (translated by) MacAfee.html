                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The few,
friends who came to see me,

new in my new state
of old work, old misery,
on those forgotten mornings

and evenings near the Penitentiary,
saw me bathed in a living light:
a meek, violent revolutionary

in my heart and language. A man was flowering.</i></b>
