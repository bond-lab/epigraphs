                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I've been trying today to bring back your face to remember just how you look. Funny how even the dearest face will fade away in time. Most clearly I remember your eyes, with a kind of teasing smiile in them, and the feeling of that soft spot just north-east of the corner of your mouth against my lips.</i></b>
