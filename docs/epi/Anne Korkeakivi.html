                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"Needs must thou find another way to flee,"
He answered, seeing my eyes with weeping fill,
"If thou from this wild place wouldst get thee free;
Because this beast, at which thou criest still,
Suffereth none to go upon her path,
But hindereth and entangleth till she kill,
And hath a nature so perverse in wrath,
Her craving maw never is satiated
But after food the fiercer hunger hath."</i></b>

Only the birds and the stream have their noise,
The twittering, bubbling sounds of nature.
Apart from this -- silence which nothing destroys.</i></b>
