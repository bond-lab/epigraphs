                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>An ordinary man of average weight and fitness embarking on a total fast - that is, a fast during which he refuses both his food and drink - could not expect to live for more than thirthy days, nor to be conscious for more than twenty-five. For him, the forty days of fasting described in religious texts would not be achievable - except with divine help, of course. History, however, does not record an intervention of that kind, and medicine opposes it.</i></b>
