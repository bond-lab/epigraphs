                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>For all the mad housewives who weren’t
The wind doth blow today, my love,
And a few small drops of rain;
I never had but one true-love;
In cold grave she was lain.
I’ll do as much for my true-love
As any young man may;
I’ll sit and mourn all at her grave
For a twelvemonth and a day.
The twelvemonth and a day being up,
The dead began to speak:
‘Oh who sits weeping on my grave,
and will not let me sleep?’
</i></b>
