                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Not so, not cold ! but very poor instead !
Ask God who knows ! for frequent tears have run 
The colours from my life, and left so dead
And pale a stuff, it were not fitly done
To give the same as pillow to thy head,
Go farther ! Let it serve to trample on. </i></b>
