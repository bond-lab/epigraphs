                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I know that all beneath the moon decays, 
And what by mortals in this world is brought, 
In time's great periods shall return to nought. 
I know that all the muses' heavenly rays, 
With toil of sprite which are so dearly bought, 
As idle sounds, of few or none are sought-
That there is nothing lighter than mere praise.</i></b>
