                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Too many conflicting emotional interests are involved for life ever to be wholly acceptable, and possibly it is the work of the storyteller to rearrange things so that they conform to this end. In any case, in talking about the past we lie with every breath we draw.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Call the death by any name Your Highness will, 
attribute it to whom you will, 
or say it might have been prevented how you will. 
It is the same death eternally -- inborn, inbred, 
engendered in the corrupted humours of the vicious body itself, 
and that only -- Spontaneous Combustion, 
and none other of all the deaths that can be died.</i></b>
