I went down the pits seventy-two fathoms deep
Invisible as a fly, not seen from the pit head

Only when I return to the surface
Is my life safe...

Blessed be the scaffolding deep down in the shaft
Blessed be the life wheel on the mine's pit head
Blessed be the chain attached to the life wheel...</i></b>
