                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Sheherezade saved 1001 girls. We know the stories that saved these girls, but we know nothing of their history; they got away, winning their right to anonymity thatnks to Sheherazade's nightly performances, her exhibitionism. If one could imagine the lives of 1001 girls who weren't murdered by Sharyar, one could write a true history of the Islamic Middle Ages.</i></b>
