Jumping from the chair she sat in.
Time, you thief, who love to get
Sweets into your list, put that in.

Say that health and wealth have missed me;
Say i'm growing old, but add--
Jenny kissed me!</i></b>

It has been shown by many social experiments that man cannot control every facet of life. All we can do is to try to isolate the factors that are the keys to the entire structure, and to work on them. These are basically: the conservation of natural resources; power-production; population-control; the full utilization of brainpower; and education. The details of the social structure will fall into place automatically as the end product of all these forces; as they always have done…
Political unification of the world is not the first necessary step. By the time it has become possible without turmoil, it will also have become unnecessary.</i></b>
