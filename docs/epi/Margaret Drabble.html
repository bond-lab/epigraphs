                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Through winter-time we call on spring,
And through the spring on summer call,
And when abounding hedges ring
Declare that winter's best of all;
And after that there's nothing good
Because the spring-time has not come -- 
Nor know that what disturbs our blood
Is but its longing  for the tomb.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Drowning is not so pitiful
 As the attempt to rise. 
 Three times, 't is said, a sinking man 
 Comes up to face the skies, 
 And then declines forever 
 To that abhorred abode 
 Where hope and he part company,â€” 
 For he is grasped of God. 
 The Maker's cordial visage, 
 However good to see, 
 Is shunned, we must admit it, 
 Like an adversity.</i></b>
