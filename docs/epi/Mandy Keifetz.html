                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Humanity is faced with a double perspective: in one direction, violent pressure, horror and death -- precisely the perspective of poetry -- and in the oppposite direction, that of science or the real world of utility. Only the useful, the real, have a serious character. We are never within our rights in preferring seduction. Truth has rights over us. Indeed, it has every right. And yet we can, and indeed we must, respond to something which, not being God, is stronger than every right, that impossible to which we accede only by forgetting the truth of all these rights, only by accepting disappearance.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Preface to "The Impossible"</i>,  (1947), Book, France
