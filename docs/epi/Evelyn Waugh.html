                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>;Well, in our country,' said Alice, still
panting a little, you’d generally get to
somewhere else -- if you ran very fast for a long time, as we've been doing.'
'A slow sort of country!' said the Queen. 'Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!'

If I wasn't real,' Alice said -- half laughing through her tears, it all seemd so ridiculous -- 'I shouldn't be able to cry.'
'I hope you don't suppose those are real tears?' Tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt.</i></b>
