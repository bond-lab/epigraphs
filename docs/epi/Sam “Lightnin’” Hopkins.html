                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You know, the blues is something that’s hard to get acquainted with. It’s just like death. Now, I tell you about the blues. The blues dwells with you every day and everywhere. See, you can have the blues about that you’re broke. You can have the blues about your girl is gone. The blues comes so many different ways until it’s kind of hard to explain. But whenever you get a sad feeling, you can tell the whole round world you got nothing but the blues.</i></b>
