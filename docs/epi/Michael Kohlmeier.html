                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Little man: "I've got an umbrella."
"That's a nice umbrella. Nice and big."
Little man: "But it's not raining."
"True. You have an umbrella because it might rain. Seems like it's going to, as well. Look at those black clouds!"
Little man: "If it rains, I'm not going to put my umbrella up."
"Why not? I mean, you'll get wet, and your umbrella can save you from getting wet, and when you're wet, when you're soaked through, you can easily get sick." 
Little man: "I'm not putting my umbrella up because it's new."
"Are you afraid it might get broken?"
Little man: "If I don't put it up, it won't break."
You're right there. But then you might as well leave it at home."
Little man: "If I leave it at home, people will ask me if I don't have an umbrella."</i></b>
