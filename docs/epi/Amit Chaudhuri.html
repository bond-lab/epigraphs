                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My days are pallid with the hard punnelling of work, 
my nights are incandescent with waking dreams. 
Arise from the clash of metals, O beautiful one, white fire-flame, 
may the mass of matter become wind, the moon become woman, 
may the flowers of the earth become the stars of the sky. 
Arise, O sacred lotus, rise from the spirit's stalk, 
fire the eternal in the unfading forgiveness of the moment, 
make the momentary eternal. 
May the body become mind, the mind become spirit, the spirit 
unite with death, 
may death become body, spirit, mind.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>...I have tried to be as faithful to my recollections as I possibly could be. No doubt the unreliability and capriciousness of memory have led me to run together certain incidents and occasions, and to confuse some of the people involved in them. But if I have done these things,  they have been done inadvertently. At no point have I deliberately departed from what I remember, or believe I remember. 
At the same time... I wanted not only to tell the trurh, as far as I knew it, about experiences I had been through or people with whom I had been involved, but also to produce tales, real stories, narratives which would provoke the reader's curiousity and satisfy it; which would appear to begin naturally, develop in a surprising and persuasive manner, and come to an end no sooner or later than they should.</i></b>
