                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"I stand amid the roar
Of a sur-tormented shore, 
And I hold within my hand 
Grains of the golden sand -- 
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep, 
While I weep -- While I weep! 
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp? 
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Firebird, golden (largous automobilus yellowsih)
1. A car manufactured by Pontiac. In this particular case, a car painted a color called Signet Gold and built in Lordstown, Ohio, in 1967. Almost sixteen feet long, with extremely poor gas mileage and no modern amenities. Has a cream-colored interior and a black convertible top and belches noxious clouds of instant-cancer fumes whenever started. Attracts an unreasonable amount of attention from car buffs (for its collectability) and others (because it's brightly colored, noisy, and as big as a battleship.)
2. A mythical creature prominently featured in Russian folktales. Possesses magical powers. Wherever the Firebird goes, princes, princesses, kings and mad wizards are sure to follow.
3. Presumably, any golden bird that's on fire.</i></b>
