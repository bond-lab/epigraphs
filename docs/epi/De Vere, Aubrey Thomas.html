                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>“Love thy God, and love Him only, 
And thy breast will ne’er be lonely. 
In that One Great Spirit meet 
All things mighty, grave, and sweet. 
Vainly strives the soul to mingle 
With a being of our kind; 
Vainly hearts with hearts are twined: 
For the deepest still is single. 
An impalpable resistance 
Holds like natures still at distance. 
Mortal: love that Holy One, 
Or dwell for aye alone.”</i></b>
