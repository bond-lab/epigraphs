                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>dear friend, only the gods can never age, 
the gods can never die. All else in the world
almighty Time obliterates, crushes all
to nothing. The earth's strength wastes away,
the strength of a man's body wastes and dies -- 
faith dies, and bad faith comes to life,
and the same wind of friendship cannot blow forever,
holding steady and strong between two friends,
much less between two cities. 
For some of us soon, for others later,
joy turns to hate and back to love again.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>,  (-401), Book, Greece
