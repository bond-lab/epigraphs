                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>One of these days I'll write a poem
about the sky, a rose pinned on a bosom, 
my kitten, the vagabond violin,
two palms soaring in happy heights,
bread crumbling in a faraway room, 
a paper fan, 
a sultry black girl;
about sponges,
grapes, new clothes,
the kites of Shoubra;
about chess
a bridge to the gallows.
a jar of sleeping pills,
a foal leaping over a rail
as the iron pierces his belly,
about a child in a nightshirt,
a rainbow after Eid prayers,
the splashes of the sea...
I'll write one day, 
I'll write a poem,
I'll write it, and if I don't, so what...
Birds are not obliged to sing.</i></b>
