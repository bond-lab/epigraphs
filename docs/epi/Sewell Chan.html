                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There has also been some inconsistency regarding what the sankofa, thought to stand for a West African proverb, means. The 2006 [African Burial Ground project] reports render the proverb as, "It is not a taboo to return and fetch it when you forget," while the new interpretive display offers the easier-to-grasp phrase, "Look to the past to understand the present."</i></b>
