                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In light of what I have done and all that I have seen, there is no doubt in my mind that if I am discovered, I will surely hang. It is unlikely that anone will ever know of the sacrifices my comrades and I have made, or of the loyalty with which we have served our king and country. Rest assured, however, that I am not the villain in all of this, but a soldier who fights for truth and justice.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Even though I fear for the future, I find I have no choice but to actâ€”indeed, morality and honour compel me to do so, my only consolation being that I will not be facing this battle alone. How great my influence will be remains uncertain, but I must at least try to make a difference.
 To those of you who many happen upon these words in the future, please rest assured that my companions and I did what we could, and that even if I were to die tomorrow, it would be with a clear conscience.</i></b>

The helplessness I feel, knowing that many more lives will be lost, is beyond compare. My prayers go out to them and their families with the solemn promise that my comrades and I are doing all that we can in order to end this.</i></b>
