                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>What is passion? It is surely the becoming of a person…In passion, the body and the spirit seek expression…The more extreme and the more expressed that passion is, the more unbearable does life seem without it. It reminds us that if passion dies or is denied, we are partly dead and that soon, come what may, we will be wholly so. </i></b>
