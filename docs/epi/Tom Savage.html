<li>IN: <i>Mrs. John Doe</i> (2015) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>LADY MACDUFF. Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm. But I remember now
I am in this earthly world, where to do harm
Is often laudable, to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,
Do I put up that womanly defence
To say I have done no harm?
[Enter murderers.]
What are these faces?
FIRST MURDERER. Where is your husband?
LADY MACDUFF. I hope, in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Macbeth (act IV, scene II)</i>,  (1623), Play, UK
