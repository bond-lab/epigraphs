                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Life means love. We are here for love. Only love is real, and everything is real thank to love. We are nomads wandering through illusionary space. How to make it real? Only by destroying limits that separate us from others. No violence, no attempts at escape can help, only love. Too often love is more painful than joyful. The instances of love are much shorter than the periods during which we wait for love to emerge. The meaning of living is mastering the art of waiting.</i></b>
