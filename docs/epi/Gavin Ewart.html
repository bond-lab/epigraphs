                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>That bowler-hatted major, his face twitching,
He's been in captivity too long.
He needs a new war and a tank in the desert.
The fat legs of the typists are getting ready
For the boys and the babies. At the back of my mind
An ant stands up and defies a steam-roller.</i></b>
