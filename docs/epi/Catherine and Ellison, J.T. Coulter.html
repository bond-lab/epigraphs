                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done; 
The ship has weatherâ€™d every rack, the prize we sought is won; 
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, 
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; 
But O heart! heart! heart! 
O the bleeding drops of red, 
Where on the deck my Captain lies, 
Fallen cold and dead. </i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>O Captain! My Captain!</i>,  (1865), Poem, US
