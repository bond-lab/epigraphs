                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The world is nearly all parceled out, and what there is left of it is being divided up, conquered, and colonized. To there of these stars that you see overhead at night, these vast worlds which we can never reach. I would annex the planets if I could; I often think of that. It makes me sad to see them so clear and yet so far.</i></b>
