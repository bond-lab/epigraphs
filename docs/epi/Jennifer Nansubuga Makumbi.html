                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I profess accurately to describe naked Africa... If the picture be a dark one, we should, when contemplating these sons of Noah, try and carry our mind back to that time when our poor elder brother Ham was cursed by his father, and condemned to be the slave of both Shem and Japheth; for as they were then, so they appear to be now -- a striking exising proof of the Holy Scriptures.</i></b>
