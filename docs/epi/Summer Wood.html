                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In this city, life happens in the street. 
A man walks out for a salami sandwich and comes back in love. 
A housewife turns into a taxi driver; a taxi driver trades his union card for some high heels and fishnet stockings --and nobody blinks an eye. Even the poor, beleaguered elms crack the sidewalks with their inspired reach for the sun. And since the year is 1965 and this city is San Francisco, home to saints and sinners and seekers of every stripe, it comes as no surprise for a young woman dressed in the madras skirt and flowing cotton blouse of a bohemian to lie back on a grassy stretch of Rolph Playground and give birth to a large, perfect, beautiful baby boy.
Presto! Change-O! 
Become a mother.</i></b>
