                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>O glorious end of life's short day of sadness!
O blessed course so well and nobly run!
O home of true and everlasting gladness!
O crown unfading! and so early won!

Though tears will fall, we bless Thee, O our Father,
For the dear one for ever with the blest!
And wait the Easter dawn when Thou shalt gather
Thine own, long parted, to their endless rest.</i></b>
