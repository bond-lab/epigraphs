                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Fire in the woods -- A fire broke out in the woods near Fair Haven Pond, in this Town, about ten o'clock, last Tuesday forenoon. It extended with great rapidity, and was not subdued until late in the afternoon. The extent of ground over which the fire prevailed is variously estimated, the lowest estimate placing it at not less than 300 acres.</i></b>
