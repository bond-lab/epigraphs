And what did I see I had not seen before? 
Only a question less or a question more; 
Nothing to match the flight of wild birds flying, 
Tiresome heart, forever living and dying, 
House without air, I leave you and lock your door. 
Wild swans, come over the town, come over 
The town again, trailing your legs and crying!</i></b>

People that buy a plot of ground
Shaped like a house, and build a house there, 
Far from the sea-board, far from the sound 

Of water sucking the hollow ledges, 
Tons of water striking the shore -- 
What do they long for, as I long for 
One salt smell of the sea once more? 

People the waves have not awakened, 
Spanking the boats at the harbour's head, 
What do they long for, as I long for, --
Starting up in my inland bed, 

Beating the narrow walls, and finding 
Neither a window nor a door, 
Screaming to God for death by drowning -- 
One salt taste of the sea once more?</i></b>
