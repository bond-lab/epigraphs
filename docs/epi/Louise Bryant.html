                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We have here in America an all too obvious and objectionable prejudice against Russia. And this, you will agree, is born of fear. In Russia, something strange and foreboding has occurred, it threatens to undo our present civilization and instinctively we fear change? There are those among us who whisper that this change will mean darkness and chaos, there are those who claim it is but a golden light which, starting from a little flame, shall circle the earth and make it glow with happiness. All that is not for me to say. I am but a messenger who lays his notes before you.</i></b>
