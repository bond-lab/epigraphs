                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We could see them through the trellis, 
From the pit where we sat, 
Framed, 
Two boys swapping stickers. 
The two of us 
Talking of battlefields and bedrooms, 
And swapping stickers. 
And how the faces are now changed,
The frames frayed 
But become something mirror-familiar â€“ 
Each other's heroes, perhaps. 
And, even across enemy lines, 
Brothers, being there. 
And how paths part, criss-cross 
Through sanded pits and poppy fields, 
Then meet again, 
At a point somewhere solid, 
Framed, like a medal. 
At its heart two boys 
Swapping stickers.</i></b>
