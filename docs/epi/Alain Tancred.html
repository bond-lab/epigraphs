                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>... but we are by now weary of the piety of galleries and the gaudiness of churches. Instead, we stroll along the Avenue of Fame, where, amongst the busts and bronzes of little distinction, we find the lifesized statue of a naked boy, placed there through the benefaction of a will in 1939. Our guide assures us that the boy steps down from his pedestal at night and causes trouble in the town. He has witnesses it himself, he says: the trouble and the pedestal, though not the child.</i></b>
