                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Whatever [the criminal] touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as silent evidence against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints, but his hair, the fibres from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches, the blood or semen he deposits or collects - all these and more bear mute witness against him. This is evidence that does not forget. It is not confused by the excitement of the moment. It is not absent because human witnesses are. It is factual evidence. Phyiscal evidence cannot be wrong; it cannot prejure itself; it cannot be wholly absent... Only human failure to find it, study and understand it, can diminish its value.</i></b>
