                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Agincourt is one of the most instantly and vividly visualized of all epic passages in English history…. It is a victory of the weak over the strong, of the common soldier over the mounted knight, of resolution over bombast…. It is also a story of slaughter-yard behaviour and of outright atrocity.</i></b>
