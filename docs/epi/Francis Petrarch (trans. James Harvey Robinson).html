                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>At last, though, my hope was fading gradually away. Except for a few of the opening lines of certain books, from which there seemed to flash upon me the face of the friend whom I had been longing to behold, a momentary glimpse, dim through distance, or, rather, the sight of his streaming hair, as he vanished from my view -- except for this... I had no hope of being able ever to see you face to face.</i></b>
