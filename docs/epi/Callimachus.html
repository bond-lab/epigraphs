                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And how many times, goddess, 
did you test your bow? 
First at an elm
Next you shot an oak
And third some wild beast.

And fourth you shot not into a tree
but a city of unjust men, who betray
their guests and themselves with
many wicked deeds. On them
you press your fearsome wrath.</i></b>
