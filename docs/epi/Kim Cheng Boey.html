                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>By the bank the slender grass stirs in the breeze,
on the lone boat the mast looms in the dark.
Over the wild level plains stars are falling,
while the moon heaves on mighty river's tides.
How will one's name live in words?
Old and sick, I've quit office for good.
Drifting from place to place, what have I become?
A solitary gull between heaven and earth.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>"Thoughts on a Night Passage"</i>,  (768), Poem, China
