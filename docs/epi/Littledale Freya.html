                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Then one morning, when the last of the snow had melted, she came to the old couple and kissed them both. "I must leave you now," she said. "Why?" they cried. "I am a child of the snow. I must go where it is cold." "No! No!" they cried. "You cannot go!" They held her close, and a few drops of snow fell to the floor. Quickly she slipped from their arms and ran out the door. "Come back!" they called. "Come back to us!"</i></b>
