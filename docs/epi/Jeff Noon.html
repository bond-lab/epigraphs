<li>IN: <i>Automated Alice</i> (1996) Fiction, British
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Now in my trembling days I seek 
All comfort to be found
In contemplation of the past;
When we rowed aground
At Godstow on the Thames' bank, 
With my sweet Alice bound. 

And there beneath a spreading elm
I told a tale of joy
To a child who smiled to hear
This older man's employ. 
But now that girl is married to
Some fine and dashing boy. 

And I am near my maker's house,
There to sup the chalice, 
With one last tale to tell as time
Works my shape with malice; 
Of how a child will become my 
Automated Alice. 

Now in these final days I seek
To find a future clime; 
In which my Alice can escape
The radishes of time. 
Faster, faster ticks the clock that 
Turns to end this rhyme.</i></b>
