                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Lord: Therein thou'rt free, according to thy merits:
The like of thee have never moved My hate. 
Of all the bold, denying Spirits,
The waggish knave least trouble doth create.
Man's active nature, flagging, seeks too soon the level;
Unqualified repose he learns to crave;
Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave,
Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil.</i></b>
