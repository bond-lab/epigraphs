                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I can see the farmers seeding 
By the brown Assiniboine, 
And a turnin' prairie gumbo 
Into heaps of shining coin. 
In the foothills of the Rockies 
I can see the steers at rest, 
And that's why in old Toronto 
I'm a-pinin' for the West. 
Where the sparkling sunbeams glance 
All across the wide expanse 
And the ozone in the breezes
Makes your pulse throb and dance. 

On the road to Rupert's Land 
Are the boys that understand. 
For in spring their feet are turning 
To that free and fertile land. 

I can see the smacks a-fishing 
On Lake Winnipeg so wide, 
And the lumber steamers loading 
By the humming sawmill's side. 
I can see the silent redmen 
As they row the livelong day
In the big fur-laden York boats 
On the road to Hudson Bay. 
And the lonely miners stand 
To wash out the golden sand 
And the summer throw her lilies 
Like a garment o'er the land. 

On the road to Rupert's Land 
Are the girls that understand, 
For when nations are a-building 
You will find them close at hand. 

Put me somewhere west of Selkirk
When the prairie roses bloom, 
Where you run clean out o' fences. 
And a man has elbow room. 
Let me ride upon the pilot 
When the first through train goes out, 
Let me hear the settlers welcome it 
With joyous ringing shout. 
Let me be upon the prairie
When they start a baby town, 
When they're living under canvas
While the first mud-sills go down ; 
For it rarely stirs the bloos 
To see the cities in the bud 
And to feel a nation growing 
From that sticky prairie mud. 

On the road to Rupert's Land 
You will find a mighty band, 
For they're going West by thousands 
Now they've come to understand.</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>The Case of Richard Meynell</i> (1911) Fiction, British
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear 
The longest date do melt like frosty rime, 
That in the morning whitened hill and plain 
And is no more; drop like the tower sublime 
Of yesterday, which royally did wear 
His crown of weeds, but could not even sustain 
Some casual shout that broke the silent air, 
Or the unimaginable touch of Time.</i></b>
