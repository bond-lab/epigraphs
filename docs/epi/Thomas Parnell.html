                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Now from yon black and fun'ral yew,
That bathes the charnel-house with dew,
Methinks I hear a voice begin;
(Ye ravens, cease your croaking din;
Ye tolling clocks, no time resound
O'er the long lake and midnight ground
It sends a peal of hollow groans,
Thus speaking from among the bones.</i></b>

Whose Pillars swell with sculptur'd Stones, 
Arms, Angels, Epitaphs and Bones,
These (all the poor Remains of State)
Adorn the Rich, or praise the Great;
Who while on Earth in Fame they live,
Are senseless of the Fame they give.</i></b>
