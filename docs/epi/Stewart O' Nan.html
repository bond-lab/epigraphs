where the venerable elm sickens, and hardens
with tarred cement, where no leaf
is born, or falls, or resists till winter.

But I remember its former fertility,
how everything came out clearly 
in the hour of credulity
and young summer, when this street 
was already somewhat overshaded,
and here at the altar of surrender, 
i met you,
the death of thirst in my brief flesh.</i></b>
