                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Blackface is the easiest make-up in the entire make-up box, and requires little or no experience to do acceptably. While any other character requires a great deal of thought, stufy and experimental work, the "nigger" make-up is the most elemental, simple in application and anyone using the least care can achieve a satisfactory result, with little or no practice.</i></b>
