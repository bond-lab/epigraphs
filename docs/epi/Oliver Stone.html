                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We’ve come to know it as the “magic bullet” theory.
  The magic bullet enters the President’s back, headed downward at an angle of 17 degrees. 
 It then moves upward in order to leave Kennedy’s body from the front of his neck—his neck wound number two—where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns right and con­tinues into Connally’s body at the rear of his right armpit—wound number three. Then, the bullet heads downward at an angle of 27 degrees, shattering Connally’s fifth rib and leaving from the right side of his chest—wounds four and five. The bullet con­tinues downward and then enters Connally’s right wrist—wound number six—shatter­ing the radius bone. It then enters his left thigh—wound number seven—from which it later falls out and is found in almost pristine condition on a stretcher in a corridor of Parkland Hospital.
  That’s some bullet.</i></b>
