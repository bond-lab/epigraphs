                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Exile is strangely compelling to think about but terrible to experience. It is the unhealable rift forced between a human being and a native place, between the self and its true home: its essential sadness can never be surmounted. And while it is true that literature adn history contain heroic, romantic, glorious, even triumphant episodes in an exile's life, these are not more than efforts meant to overcome the crippling sorrow of estrangement. The achievements of exile are permanently undermined by the loss of something left behind forever.</i></b>
