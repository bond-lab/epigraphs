                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It's Said
That every soul enters
this world an immaculate slate.
awaiting the imprint
of parent and teacher,
the scribbling of providence.

But no truth is absolute.

More often than supposed,
a mind is born defective,
hairline fractures
spidering the native psyche,
flaws invisible to the eye.

Some cracks can't be mortared.</i></b>
