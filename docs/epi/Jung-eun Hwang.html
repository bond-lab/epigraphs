In common with many other cultures, Koreans refer to a sunhower using this lovely epithet -- the meteorological phenomenon of rain while the sun shines apparently indicating the wedding of a fox. The fox's partner varies around the world; in Korea, the marriage is either between a tiger groom and a fox bride. The Korean kumiho (lit. 'nine-tailed fox') shares many similarities with the Chinese huli jing and Japanese kitsune, though while these latter are often depicted as morally ambiguous, the kumiho is almost always malignant. Using a literal translation rather than the more prosaic 'sunshower' seemed appropriate for the eerie, shape-shifting nature of this darkly modern fairy tale.</i></b>
