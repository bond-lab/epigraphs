                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Prospero: 
A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains, 
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
And as with age his body uglier grows,
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all, 
Even to roaring.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Tempest</i>,  (1623), Play, UK
