                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Floating on the water at the edge of the canal, hardly visible, was a bundle, wrapped tightly in a soiled white blanket. It was small, benign, but eerie. Gently, it glided away and began its grisly procession down the middle of the canal, on an almost imperceptible current. Transfixed, they watched its progress, the bundle finally passing under the full glare of one of the restaurant's outside lamps. The beam illuminated the blood-spattered wrapping - and the place where the parcel had come partially untied.
  From which a disembodied hand, fingers outstretched, clawed its way to the light.</i></b>
