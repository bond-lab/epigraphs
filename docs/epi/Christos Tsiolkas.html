                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>To a saintly man 
-- So goes an Arab tale --
God said somewhat maliciously:
'Had I revealed to people
How great a sinner you are,
They could not praise you.'
'And I,' answered the pious one,
'Had I unveiled to them
How merciful you are,
They would not care for you.'</i></b>
