                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>John Milton proved fruitful in still one more respect. He was versatile, and Major Major soon found himself incorporating the signature in fragments of imaginary dialogues. Thus, typical endorsements on the official documents might read, 'John, Milton is a sadist' or 'Have you seen Milton, John?' One signature of which he was especially proud read, 'Is anybody in the John, Miltion?' John Milton threw open whole new vistas filled with charming, inexhaustible possibilities that promised to ward off monotony forever.</i></b>
