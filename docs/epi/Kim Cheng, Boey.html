                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the army / they taught my hands / to take weapons apart, keep them / cleaned and oiled, put them together again / to plant bullets in the enemy's dreams. / Then they trained my hands / to arm and disarm bombs / till they became masters of stillness / in first making them tick, then moving / to defuse, to make safe. / Now the bolts of my speech / are jammed; my hands tremble / to approach the silence. If I trip, / the house of words will tumble down.</i></b>
