                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear,
Fays, Fairies, Genni, Elves, and Demons, hear!
Ye know the spheres, and various talks assign'd
By laws eternal to th' aerial kind:
Some in the fields of purest ather play,
And bask, and whiten, in the blaze of day;
Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high,
Or roll the planets thro' the boundless sky:
Our humbler province is to tend the Fair,
Not a less pleasing, nor less glorious care.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Rape of the Lock</i>,  (1712), Poem, UK
