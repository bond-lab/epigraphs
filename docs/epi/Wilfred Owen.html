Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,
But mocks the steady running of the hour, 
And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here...</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Move him into the sun -- 
Gently its touch awoke him once, 
At home, whispering of fields unsown.
Always it woke him, even in France,
Until this morning and this snow.
If anything might rouse him now
The kind old sun will know.

Think how it wakes the seeds -- 
Woke, once, the clays of a cold star.
Are limbs so dear-achieved, are sides
Full-nerved, -- still warm, -- too hard to stir? 
Was it for this the clay grew tall?
-- O what made fatuous sunbeams toil
To break earth's sleep at all?</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>She sleeps on soft, last breaths; but no ghost looms
Out of the stillness of her palace wall,
Her wall of boys on boys and dooms on dooms.

She dreams of golden gardens and sweet glooms,
Not marvelling why her roses never fall
Nor what red mouths were torn to make their blooms.

The shades keep down which well might roam her hall.
Quiet their blood lies in her crimson rooms
And she is not afraid of their footfall.

They move not from her tapestries, their pall,
Nor pace her terraces, their hecatombs,
Lest aught she be disturbed, or grieved at all.</i></b>
