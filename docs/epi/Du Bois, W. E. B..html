                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>O water, voice of my heart, crying in the sand, 
All night long crying with a mournful cry, 
As I lie and listen, and cannot understand 
The voice of my heart in my side or the voice of the sea, 
O water, crying for rest, is it I, is it I? 
All night long the water is crying to me. 

Unresting water, there shall never be rest
Till the last moon droop and the last tide fail, 
And the fire of the end begin to burn in the west; 
And the heart shall be weary and wonder and cry like the sea, 
All life long crying without avail, 
As the water all night long is crying to me.</i></b>
