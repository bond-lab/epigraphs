                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>This is a land where clouds come to die. Fresh young winds, born in Canada, migrate south, over Lake Ontario, where they pick up moisture, and transform into billowing clouds. Once the clouds reach the Empire State, they release their burden as rain or snow, lose elevation and bulk to land on these once-majestic mountains that the glaciers churned and scoured and ground into mere nubby hills. The clouds break apart and roll down the hills, down into the valleys, down into the deepest creases, down into farms and tiny villages that burrowed themselves into the hides of the steep hillsides and valley floors.</i></b>
