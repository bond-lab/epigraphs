                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The odd capacity for destination, as if by nature we ought to have so much more than nature gives us. As if we are shockingly unclothed when we lack the complacencies of ordinary life. In destitution, even of feeling or purpose, a human being is more hauntingly human and vulnerable to kindnesses because there is the sense that things should be otherwise, and the thought of what is wanting and what is alleviation would be, and how the soul could be put at case, restored. At home. But the soul finds its own home if it ever has a home at all.</i></b>
