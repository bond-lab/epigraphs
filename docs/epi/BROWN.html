                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b> Is this thy castle, Baldwin?  Melancholy
     Displays her sable banner from the donjon,
     Darkening the foam of the whole surge beneath.
     Were I a habitant, to see this gloom
     Pollute the face of nature, and to hear
     The ceaseless sound of wave, and seabird’s scream,
     I’d wish me in the hut that poorest peasant
     E’er framed, to give him temporary shelter.</i></b>
