                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It must be borne in mind that my design is not to write histories but lives. And the most glorious ecploits do not always furnish us with the clearest discoveries of virtue or vice in men: sometimes a matter of less moment, an expression or a jest, informs us better of their characters and inclinations, than the most famous sieges, the greatest armaments, or the bloodiest battles whatsoever.</i></b>
