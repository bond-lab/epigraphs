                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I remember going into a meeting with a silver anniversary catalog of every film in the Film Board ever made and waving it around saying, "Do you see a listing in the film catalog under 'Gay'? Under 'Homosexual'? No you do not." There was a film that had been about a group of lesbian writers in Quebec, and the catalog described them as Quebecoise writers! Even here the history had been made invisible, and that's a political choice.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We really wanted to celebrate resistance, to unearth this invisible history, but we wanted to do it in an entirely engaging and entertaining way. Why should it dour? What really gives people energy in the resistance is not being dour, it's being rebellious.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Perhaps, instead of thinking of identity as an already accomplished fact, which the new cinematic discourses then represent, we should think instead of identity as a production, which is never complete, always in process, and always constituted within, not outside, representation.</i></b>
