                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
 Whose woods these are I think I know.
 His house is in the village though,
 He will not see me stopping here
 To watch his woods fill up with snow. 
 My little horse must think it queer 
 To stop without a farmhouse near 
 Between the woods and frozen lake 
 The darkest evening of the year. 
 He gives his harness bells a shake 
 To ask if there is some mistake. 
 The only other soundâ€™s the sweep 
 Of easy wind and downy flake. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, 
 But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening</i>,  (1923), Poem, US
