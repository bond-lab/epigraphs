                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>August Town, in the hills of St. Andrew, Jamaica is thought to have been named from the fact that freedom came to the enslaved people of this country on 'Augus Mawnin' -- the 1st August, 1838. August Town later became notable because at this place a prophet, whose name was Bedward, arose. He had thousands of followers, but outdid himself when he proclaimed that he was God and could fly.</i></b>
