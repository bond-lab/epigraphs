                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>No man is an island, entire of it self;
every man is a piece of the continent, a
part of the main; if a clod be washed
away by the sea, Europe is the less, as
well as if a promontory were, as well as
if a manor of thy friends or of thine own
were; any man's death diminishes me,
because I am involved in mankind; and
therefore never send to know for whom
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</i></b>
