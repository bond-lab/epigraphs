                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Term " Global Warming" is as misleading as it is inaccurate. True, the overall temperature of the earth as measured by annual average readings will rise. But the averages tell us next to nothing. A shortening of a rainy season by two weeks in a given area might be reflected as an increase in the average annual temperature of only a third of a degree. But the impack on the water supply -- and thus the growing season would be considerably higher.
Paradoxically, rapid climate change may bring much lower temperatures in many places. It should noted that some changes may well benefit people in the affected areas, at least temporarily, by extending growing seasons, negating weather extremes, or having some other unpredictable effect.
Unfortunately, the sensationalistic term, combined with the slow evolution of the effects prior to the crisis point, will make it hard to convince the general population of true danger.</i></b>
