                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You can't spend your life returning, especially to that cesspool of a country of yours, that disaster they've turned your parents' home into, just so you can say hi or bring us words of consolation. 
Here, every act of pity is cruel if it doesn't set something on fire.
Every sign of maturity must prove its capacity for destruction.</i></b>
