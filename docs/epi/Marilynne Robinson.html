                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Imagine that Noah knocked his house apart and used the planks to build an ark, while his neighbors looked on, full of doubt. A house, he must have told them, should be daubed with pitch and built to float cloud high, if need be. A lettuce patch was of no use at all, and a good foundation was worse than useless. A house should have a compass and a keel. The neighbors would have put their hands in their pockets and chewed their lips and strolled home to houses they now found wanting in ways they could not understand.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The odd capacity for destination, as if by nature we ought to have so much more than nature gives us. As if we are shockingly unclothed when we lack the complacencies of ordinary life. In destitution, even of feeling or purpose, a human being is more hauntingly human and vulnerable to kindnesses because there is the sense that things should be otherwise, and the thought of what is wanting and what is alleviation would be, and how the soul could be put at case, restored. At home. But the soul finds its own home if it ever has a home at all.</i></b>
