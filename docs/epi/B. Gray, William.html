                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>She is more to be pitied than censured,
She is more to be helped than despised.
She is only a lassie who ventured
On life’s stormy path ill-advised.
Do not scorn her with words fierce and bitter,
Do not laugh at her shame and downfall.
For a moment, just stop and consider
That a man was the cause of it all.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>a popular ballad of the 1890s</i>,  (1898), Song, US
