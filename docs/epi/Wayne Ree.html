                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We're here, oh god, for even the briefest of moments, 
And for these moments, these are the miraculous 
things we see and can do.

This is our love and our fear and our hate and our joy.
This is everything we wanted, this is everything we were.
These were our possibilities.
These were our whys and our what-ifs.

THese are our stories, no matter how ridiculous.</i></b>
