                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Earth's crazy daydreamers are we,
with blazing hearts and furious eyes:
the unredeemed thinkers, the tragic lovers.
A thousand suns course through our blood
and the vision of infinity pursues us from all sides.
Form cannot master us.
We have fallen in love with the essence of our existence
and in all our loves that very essence is what we adore.
We are the great zealots and the great deniers.
Within us we contain the cosmos, and without it we are nothing.
Our days are a fire and our nights a sea.
Human laughter echoes around us.

We are the heralds of chaos.</i></b>
