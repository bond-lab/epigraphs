                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>But whether an author protested Jim Crow directly or strived to produce a work in which race didn't matter, what made African American literature a literature was the historical circumstance in which black literary achievement could cound, almost automatically, as an effort on behalf of the "race" as a whole. That circumstance was Jim Crow or legalised segregation. We are no longer in that moment. Nothing makes the work of any individual black writer a matter for the "race" as a whole.</i></b>
