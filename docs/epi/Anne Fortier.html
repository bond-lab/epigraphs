                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Amazons,
mythical race of female warriors. The name was popularly understood as "breastless" (maza, "breast") and the story told that they "pinched out" or "cauterized" the right breast so as not to impede their javelin-throwing... Amazons have been used as evidence for an actual matriarchy in prehistoric times. This has seemed an attractive counter to modern male prejudices, but mistakes the nature of myth.</i></b>
