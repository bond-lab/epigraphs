                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>On one occasion St George came to a city named Salem, near which lived a dragon who had to be fed daily with one of the citizens, drawn by lot. The day St George came there, the lot had fallen upon the King's daughter, Cleolinda. St George resolved that she should not die, and so he went out and attacked the dragon, who lived in a swamp close by and killed him.
When he was faced by a difficulty or danger, however great it appeared - even the shape of a dragon - he did not avoid it or fear it, but went at it with all the power he could put into himself and his horse. Although inadequately armed for such an encounter, having merely a spear, he charged in, did his best and finally succeeded in overcoming a difficulty which nobody had dared to tackle.
This is exactly the way in which a scout should face a difficulty or danger, no matter how great or terrifying it may appear to him or how ill-equipped he may be for the struggle.</i></b>
