                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"The trouble with innocence," Mrs Gansevoort went on, endeavoring to make a fine point, while reaching with her fingertips to touch a prospective blossom, "is that it provides its own sole protection against the depredations of nature; and nature -- God, for that matter, the grand texts notwithstanding -- has never shown much liking for it. Nature favors the bright eye! the sharp tooth! the cunning few! Nature is a tyrant queen. Make a mistake with her, and she cuts off your head."</i></b>
