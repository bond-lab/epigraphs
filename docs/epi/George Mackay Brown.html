                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>That one should leave The Green Wood suddenly
In the good comrade-time of youth
And clothed in the first coat of truth
Set out on an uncharted sea

Who'll ever know what star
Summoned him, what mysterious shell
Locked in his ear that music and that spell
And what grave ship was waiting for him there?

The greenwood empties soon of leaf and song.
Truth turns to pain. Our coats grow sere.
Barren the comings and goings on this shore. 
He anchors off The Island of the Young.</i></b>
