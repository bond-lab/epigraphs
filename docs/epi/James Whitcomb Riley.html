                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You who to the rounded prime
Of a life of toil and stress, 
Still have kept the morning-time
Of glad youth in heart and spirit,
So your laugh, as children hear it,
Seems their own, no less,--
Take this book of childish rhyme-- 
The Book of Joyous Children.

Their first happiness on earth
Here is echoed--their first glee:
Rich, in sooth, the volume's worth--
Not in classic lore, but rich in
The child-sagas of the kitchen;--
Therefore, take from me
To your heart of childish mirth
The Book of Joyous Children.</i></b>

the supper things is done,
We sit around the kitchen fire

If you Don't Watch Out!</i></b>
