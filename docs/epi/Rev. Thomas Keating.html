                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>An important fruit of contemplative prayer is to be purified of our childish ideas of God. As our idea of God expands, there is no word, no way, no gesture, that can articulate it anymore. Hence we fall into silence, the place we should have been in the first place.</i></b>
