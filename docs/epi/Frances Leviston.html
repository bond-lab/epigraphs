                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the golden age, we communed with gods. 
A god could be hidden, barely contained,
inside the costumes of normal men.
Nothing was certain. How could you refuse
a beggar's request or a gambler's wager,
the bold advance of the boss' only daughter,
without fear of causing offence to a god?
You would say yes. In the golden age, 
whatever was offered, you would say yes.</i></b>
