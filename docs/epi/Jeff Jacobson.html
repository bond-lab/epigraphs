                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Table C-1: Summary of WHO Global Pandemic Phases 
(WHO Global Influenza Preparedness Plan, 2005)

Interpandemic Period
Phase 1. No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. An influenza virus subtype that has caused human infection may be present in animals. If present in animals, the risk of human infection or disease is considered to be low.

Phase 2. No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans. However, a circulating animal influenza virus subtype poses a substantial risk of human disease.

Pandemic Alert Period
Phase 3. Human infection(s) with a new subtype but no human-to-human spread or at most rare instances of spread to a close contact.

Phase 4. Small cluster(s) with limited human-to-human spread is highly localized, suggesting that the virus is not well adapted to humans

Phase 5. Larger cluster(s) but human-to-human spread is still localized, suggesting that the virus is becoming increasingly better adapted to humans but may not yet be fully transmissible (substantial pandemic risk).

Pandemic Period
Phase 6. Pandemic phase: increased and sustained transmission in the general population.
