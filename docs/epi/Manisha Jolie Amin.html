                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The aalaap and jor should be a slow and meditative exploration of the raag. There is no rhythm in the aalaap. You must slowly and with precision introduce the listener to the various notes of the raag, showing their relationships in ascent and descent. The jor, which flows on from the aalaap, introduces a rhythm gently, with no accompaniment. The purpose is to explore the mood and characteristics of the raag. 
Performed well, the aalaap enfolds the performer and listener in a common devotion to the spirit of the raag and the Divine.</i></b>
