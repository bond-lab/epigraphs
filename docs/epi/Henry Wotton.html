                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>This day Dame Nature seem'd in love, 
The lusty sap began to move, 
Fresh juice did stir th' embracing vines, 
And birds had drawn their valentines. 
The jealous trout that low did lie, 
Rose at a well-dissembled flie. 
There stood my friend, with patient skill, 
Attending of his trembling quill.</i></b>
