                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I dreamt last night that there was wind and rain. / I got up and looked out, but all was strange; / A muddy track across a wooded plain; / A distant tumult; angry cries, exchange / Of fire. And then, out of that dreadful night, / Appeared a scarecrow army, staggering, / Defiant, famished. In the quenched starlight / They marched on to their bitter reckoning. // Their sleepless, bloodshot eyes were turned to me. / Their flags hung black against the pelting sky. / Their jests and curses echoed whisperingly, / As though from long-last years of sorrow -- Why, / You're weeping! What, then? What more did / you see? / A gray man on a gray horse rode by. </i></b>

The thought would probably have been more amplified, had our author lived to be shocked with such experiments as have been published in later times, by a race of men that have practised tortures without pity, and related them without shame, and are yet suffered to erect their heads among human beings.</i></b>
