                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>At this point I must explain that absolution by means of repentance is possible for all sins with the exception of three. One of these is elading people astray by estblishing an evil practice or issuing a wrong decision, since the damage done cannot be repaired. Of one who commits such a sin Scripture says: Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit.</i></b>
