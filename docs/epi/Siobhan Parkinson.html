                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Beshrew me but I love her heartily; 
For she is wise, if I can judge of her, 
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true. 
And true she is, as she hath proved herself, 
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true. 
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.</i></b>
