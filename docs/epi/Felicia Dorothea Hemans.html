                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Seest thou my home? 'tis where yon woods are waving,
In their dark richness to the summer air;
Where the blue stream, a thousand flower banks laving,
Leads down the hills, a vein of light - 'tis there.

My home! the spirit of its love is breathing,
In every wind that plays across my track;
From its white walls the very tendrils wreathing,
Seem with soft links to draw the wanderer back.</i></b>

With its low murmuring sounds of silvery light,
On through the dark days fading from their prime,
As a sweet dew to keep your souls from blight!
Earth will forsake. O! happy to have given
The unbroken heart's first fragrance unto Heaven.</i></b>

Thou seest what grief must nurture for the sky,
What death must fashion for eternity.</i></b>
