                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Who’ll show a child just as it is? Who’ll place it within its constellation, with the measure of distance in its hand? Who’ll make its death from grey bread, that grows hard – or leave it there, within the round mouth, like the choking core of a sweet apple? … Minds of murderers are easily divined. But this, though: death, the whole of death, – even before life’s begun, to hold it all so gently, and be good: this is beyond description!</i></b>
