                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths, 
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
OF night and light and the half light, 
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</i></b>
