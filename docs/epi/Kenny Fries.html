not only the beds you lay on,
but also thosedesires glowing openly
in eyes that looked at you
trembling for you in voices --
only some chance obstacle frustrated them
Nowthat it's all finally in yhe past,
it seems almostas if you gave yourself 
to those desires too -- how they glowed
remember, in eyes that looked at you,
remember body, how they trembled for you in those voices</i></b>
