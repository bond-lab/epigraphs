                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Persephone and her friends disport themselves in the bowered arches by the lake of Pergus, where the grass bows under their milky feet like the most sumptuous velvet and flowers put out their colours like flags waving for a celebration: lilies, irises, violets. The perfume of the flowers is so pervasive that hounds lose their trail of scent, falter and scatter, leaving the hunters to curse and return home. And so no male voice is heard in the glades, and no rough note disturbs the aural tapestry of rustling leaves and soft soprano song.</i></b>
