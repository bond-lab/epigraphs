                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>On the third day out I get it, the sea 
Is not one thing, it constantly transforms 
Itself, and in unthinking majesty 
Tapestries horizons with sun or storms. 
So then lying now, rocking to and fro 
On its soothing and gentle amniotic swell 
I loosen thoughts of home, and let them go, 
And my shipwrecked heart can start to heal. 
What promise for me, what spirit salve 
When unanchored here I find at last,  
Something has shifted, giving me resolve 
To let hope aboard, jettison the past. 
The sea has given me a chance to live,
And leads us maybe to a safe harbour, love.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Birds and the Bees: As well as being the gentle way of explaining how creatures of nature ‘do business with one another’, The Birds and the Bees (Eun S’na Sheillein) is also a Scottish country dance originating from the hamlet of Bonniebride (Buinne-Bhrìghde) in the former county of Duffshire, famed locally for the large apiary and aviary that once existed there. It is an energetic reel in which couples complete a series of many cast-offs and changes of partner. It is considered extremely fortuitous to dance this at weddings, due to its connections with an ancient ritual dedicated to Creide, faery goddess of women who ruled over love magick and the search for the perfect mate.</i></b>
