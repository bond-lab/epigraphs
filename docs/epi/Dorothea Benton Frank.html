                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>All that glitters is not gold,
Often you have heart it told:
Many a man his life has sold
But my outside to behold:
Gilded tombs do worms enfold
Had you been as wise as bold,
Young in limbs, in judgement old,
Your answer had not been in'scroll'd
Fare you well: your suit is cold. Cold, indeed, and labour lost:
Then, farewell, heat and welcome, frost!</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Sea-Drinking cities have a moon-struck air;
Houses are topped with look-outs; as a dog
Looks up with dumb eyes asking, dormers stare
At stranger-vessels and swart cunning faces.
They are touched with long sleeping in the sea-born moon;
They have heard fabled sails slatting in the dark,
Clearing with no papers, unwritten in any log,
Light as thin leaves before the rough typhoon;
Keels trace a phosper mark,
To allow old ocean-drowned green places.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Sea-Drinking Cities</i>,  (1927), Poem, US
