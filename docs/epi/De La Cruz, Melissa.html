And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans, 
Still we went coupled and inseperable.</i></b>

Well, it's like when I had this garden party for my father's birthday, right? I put R.S.V.P. ' cause it was a sit-down dinner. But some people came that, like, did not R.S.V.P., so I was, like, totally buggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish in extra place settings, but by the end of the day, it was like, the more the merrier! And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion, may I please remind you it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue of Liberty! Thank you very much.</i></b>
