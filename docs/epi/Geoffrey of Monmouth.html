                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Brutus! there lies beyond the Gallic Bounds
An island which the western sea surround,
By giants once possess'd; now few remain
To bar thy entrance, or to obstruct thy reign.
To reach that happy shore thy sails employ;
There fate decrees to raise a second Troy,
And found an empire in thy royal line,
Which time shall ne'er destroy. nor bounds confine.</i></b>
