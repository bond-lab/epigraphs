                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>While I was dizzied this, old thoughts would crowd,

Belonging to the time ere I was brought
By Arthurâ€™s great name and his little love;
Must I give up for ever then, I thought,

That which I deemed would ever round me move
Glorifying all things; for a little word,
Scarce ever meant at all, must I now prove

Stone-cold for ever?</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Defence of Guenevere</i>,  (1858), Book, UK
