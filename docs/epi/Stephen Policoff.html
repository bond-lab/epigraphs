                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Who has turned us around this way, so that
no matter what we do, we look as though we're leaving?
Like someone standing for the last time
on the last hill from which he can view
his whole valley -- the way he turns, stops, lingers --
this is the way we live, forever leaving.</i></b>
