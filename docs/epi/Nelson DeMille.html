                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>“What is it?
The phantom of a Cup which comes and goes?”
“Nay, monk! What phantom?” answered Perceval.
“The Cup, the Cup itself, from which our Lord
Drank at the last sad supper with his own.
This, from the blessed land of Aromat…
Arimathaean Joseph, journeying brought
To Glastonbury…
And there awhile it bode; and if a man
Could touch or see it, he was heal’d at once,
By faith, of all his ills. But then the times
Grew to such evil that the Holy Cup
Was caught away to Heaven and disappear’d.”</i></b>
