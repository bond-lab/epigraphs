                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I interviewed some of the girls. I asked all of them if they had read the stories of the 1001 Nights that had inspired the number of particpants at the meeting. Only one of them said that she had tried, but being a Christian, she found it hard to read "lies". I said that these "lies" were called "fiction," and that they were stories that most people on earth enjoyed even if they were made up. "When did lies become respectable?" she bristled. "When people wanted to escape from boredom and maybe from themselves," I said, rather pedantically, "Well, sooner will a camel go through the eye of a needle than a liar into the kingdom of heaven," she misquoted from her religion, and I felt it futile to insist that her religion was itself a myth made up by the writers of the Bible. I didn't want to be mean and, besides, she was cute.</i></b>
