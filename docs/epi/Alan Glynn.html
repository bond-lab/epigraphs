                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In early 2001, having saddled the pharmaceutical giant with huge debt and cut its workforce by a third, Vaughan’s Oberon Capital Group sold Eiben-Chemcorp for a profit of $457 million. It appears, however, that Oberon did this in the full knowledge that an R &D scandal involving leaked samples of a trial “smart drug” was brewing at Eiben. What is more-and is perhaps more shocking-they then shorted the buyer’s stock in order to make a double killing on the transaction.</i></b>
