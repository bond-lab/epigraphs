                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"There is but one mind in all these men, 
and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not 
immortal, look about you. Security gives way to
conspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee!
Thy lover, 
Artemidorus"
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, 
And as a suitor will I give him this.
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation.
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live.
IF not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Julius Caesar</i>,  (1623), Play, UK
