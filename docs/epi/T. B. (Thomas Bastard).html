                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When I behold, with deep astonishment, 
To famous Westminster how there resorte, 
Living in brasse or stoney monument, 
The princes and the worthies of all sorte;
Doe not I see reformde nobilitie, 
Without contempt, or pride, or ostentation, 
And looke upon offenseless majesty, 
Naked of pomp or earthly domination? 
And how a play-game of a painted stone 
Contents the quiet now and silent sprites, 
Whome all the world which late they stood upon
Could not content nor quench their appetites. 
Life is a frost of cold felicitie, 
And death the thaw of all our vanitie.</i></b>
