                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>IBB, YEMEN â€“ The CIA has declined to comment on reports of a drone strike in the Ibb province of Yemen. Several missles were fired, killing two members of the same family who were working in the fields of a remote village. A local source said, 'Yesterday's victims were a grandmother and her granddaughter - they were picking okra. We are simple farmers. The only thing people here know about America is that it kills our people. American drone strikes do not fight terrorism, they fuel it.' Despite President Obama's announcement that no strikes would be authorised unless there is 'near certainty that no civilians would be killed or injured', this is the eleventh confirmed drone strike in Yemen this year. Civilian deaths as a result are estimated at between 17 and 33, including 3 children.</i></b>
