                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Do not stand at my grave and weep.
I am not there; I do not sleep.
I am a thousand winds that blow.
I am the diamond glints on snow. 
I am the sunlight on ripened grain. 
I am the gentle autumn rain.
When you awaken in the morning's hush,
I am the the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in ciecled flight.
I am the soft stars that shine at night. 
Do not stand at my grave and cry,
I am not there. I did not die. </i></b>
