                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When you have read folktales of this god and that, you have perhaps spoken patronizingly of the old mythmakers and thanked your lucky stars that you lived in a more enlightened age. But those old storytellers were the really enlightened ones, for they saw into another world and recorded what they saw. Many of the world's favourite gods are said to have lived upon earth as men. They have so lived. Does that idea startle you? How does a man become a god, and how does a god become a man? Have you ever wondered?</i></b>
