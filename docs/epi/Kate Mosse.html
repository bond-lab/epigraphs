                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Tis now, replied the village belle,
St Mark's mysterious eve,
And all that old traditions tell
I trembingly believe;
How, when the midnight signal tolls,
Along the churchyard green,
A mournful train of sentenced souls
In winding-sheets are seen.
The ghosts of all whom death shall doom
Within the coming year,
In pale procession walk the gloom,
Amid the silence drear.</i></b>

Limping up and down our roads,
Spreading his white blanket of snow
While the Cers wind cries in the
