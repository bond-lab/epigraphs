                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Generations pass away and others go on,
since the time of the ancestors.
They that build buildings,
their places are no more.
What has been done with them?

I have heard the words of Imhotep and Hardedef,
with whose sayings men speak so much.
What are their places now?

Their walls are crumbled,
their places are non-existent,
as if they had never been.

No one returns from there,
so that he might tell us their disposition;
that he might tell us how they are,
that he might still our hearts
until we shall go to the place where they have gone.

Make holiday and weary not therein!
Behold, it is not given to a man
to take his property with him.
Behold, no one who goes can come back again.</i></b>
