                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Don't be afraid of darkness, 
for in darkness rests the light.
We see no stars or planets
without the dark of night.
The darkness of the pupil
is in the iris round,
for all light's fearful longing
has darkness at its ground.
Don't be afraid of darkness,
for in it rests the light.
Don't be afraid of darkness;
it holds the heart of light.</i></b>
