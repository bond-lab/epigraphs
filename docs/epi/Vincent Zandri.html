                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Stone walls do not a prison make,
Nor iron bars a cage; Minds innocent and quiet take
That for an hermitage. If I have my freedom in my love,
And in my soul am free, Angels alone, that soar above,
Enjoy such liberty.</i></b>

Usually they inhabit heaven where, by the way, no tears are allowed.
They push the moon around like a boiled yam.
The Milky Way is their hen with her many children.
When it is night the cows lie down but the moon, that big bull, stands up.</i></b>
