                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>... they have marked me -- even to myself. Because I am not like them, I am evil. I cannot get my hadns on it: I, murderer, outlaw, outcast... Because their way is the just way and my way -- the way of the kings and my father -- crosses them: weaklings holding together appear strong... The worst is that weak, still, somehow, they are strong: they in effect have the power, by hook or by crook. And because I am not like them -- not that I am evil but more in accord with our own blood than they, eager to lead -- this very part of me, by their trickery must not appear, unless in their jacket.</i></b>
