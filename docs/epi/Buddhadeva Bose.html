                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My days are pallid with the hard punnelling of work, 
my nights are incandescent with waking dreams. 
Arise from the clash of metals, O beautiful one, white fire-flame, 
may the mass of matter become wind, the moon become woman, 
may the flowers of the earth become the stars of the sky. 
Arise, O sacred lotus, rise from the spirit's stalk, 
fire the eternal in the unfading forgiveness of the moment, 
make the momentary eternal. 
May the body become mind, the mind become spirit, the spirit 
unite with death, 
may death become body, spirit, mind.</i></b>
