                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Evening and the flat land, 
Rich and sombre and always silent; 
The miles of fresh-plowed soil, 
Heavy and black, full of strength and harshness; 
The growing wheat, the growing weeds, 
The toiling horses, the tired men; 
The long empty roads, 
Sullen fires of sunset, fading,

Singing like the larks over the plowed fields,
 Flashing like a star out of the twilight; 
Youth with its insupportable sweetness, 
Its fierce necessity,
 Its sharp desire,</i></b>
