                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>No dark and evil story of the dead
Would leave you less pernicious or less fair-
Not even Lilith, with her famous hair;
And Lilith was the devil, I have read.

I cannot hate you, for I loved you then.
The woods were golden then. There was a road
Through beeches; and I said their smooth feet showed 
Like yours. Truth must have heard me from afar,
For I shall never have to learn again
That yours are cloven as no beech's are.</i></b>
