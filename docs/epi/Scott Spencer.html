                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I no more wrote than read that book which is 
The self I am, half-hidden as it is
From one and all who see within a kiss
The longing formless backness of an abyss

How could I think the brief years were enough
To prove the reality of endless love?</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Think of everything that has ever been said and everything that has ever been written, every book, every poem, every conversation, every scrap of paper, every encyclopaedia, in English, in Chinese, in French and Spanish and Italian and Russian and Korean and Arabic, in Swahili, in Farsi, and then think of your life. What are you next to all that? You’re like one half of a letter in one word; that’s your life, that is you front to back, up and down, over and out. But that doesn’t make what we say and do less important. It makes it more important.</i></b>
