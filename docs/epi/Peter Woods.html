                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Exile is not a word
It is a sound 
The rending of skin
A fistful of clay on top
of a coffin
Exile is not a word
It is shaving against
A photograph not a mirror
Exile is not a word
It is hands joined in 
supplication
In an empty cathedral
It is writing your own 
hagiography
It is a continuing atrocity
It is the purgatorial
Triumph of memory
over toppgraphy
Exile is not a word
Exile is not a word</i></b>
