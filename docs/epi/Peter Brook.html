                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the theatre, the tendency for centuries has been to put the actor to a remote distance, on a platform, framed, decorated, lit, painted, in high shoes -- so as to help to persuade the ignorant that he is holy, that his art is sacred. Did this express reverence? Or was there behind it a fear that something would be exposed if the light were too bright, the meeting too near?</i></b>
