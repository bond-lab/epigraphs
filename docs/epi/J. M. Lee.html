                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>New York Police Department officials said Saturday that a man in his fifties was found shot to death in a Queens home. Officers arrived on the scene around 2 a.m. in response to a 911 call reporting several gunshots. The victim, Steve Yoon, defected from North Korea and was granted asylum two years ago. According to reports, he was the head of Friends of Freedom, a human rights organization.
Sources said that the victim's face had been wiped with antiseptic. Mysterious numbers and pictures were scrawled in blood around the body. Officials arrested an unidentified man at the scene. According to hospital sources, the suspect is in stable condition after being treated for a bullet wound to the thigh. Antiseptic and the victim's blood were detected on his hands, sources said.
Officials are focusing on the victim's past employment at major North Korean government facilities. Upon arriving in the U. S. Yoon provided information about the secluded country's nuclear program. A police official said, "We aren't sure if this is a straightforward murder or something more. We are considering every possibility, including an act of retribution by North Korea to punish the information leak.</i></b>
