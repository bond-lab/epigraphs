                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>They say heroes are forged in tragedy so I suppose I qualify on that score, several times over even. But the truth of the matter is that half the time I felt like a dog that'd been kicked 'till he just couldn't stand it anymore without biting back. I'll be damned if that se ems particularly heroic to me. But the life of the boy is what shapes the man.</i></b>
