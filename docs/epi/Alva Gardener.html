                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When King Sharyar set himself to the grim task of deflowering Sheherazade in the presence of her younger sister Dinarzad, he cursed Narrative. HE cursed the history that had imprisoned him in his story, he cursed his weakness, the cowardice of his subjects, the flaws inherent to being human, adn the gods who may or may not have been in control of Narrative.Then he entered Sheherazade and it was like entering another story. No, Sharyar corrected himself, it was another story. Sheherazade opened to him the first of a thousand and one nights, she was the crossroads at which it was possible to take another path. It was possible to live again. The crossroads in his bed invited him to take the less traveled road, nay, the untraveled road. Sharyar took it, and Sheherazade remained a virgin (the first night).</i></b>
