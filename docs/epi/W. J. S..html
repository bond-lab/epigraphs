                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It was not, to restore thy flickering breath,
Or hold thee back, just nearing towards the Light,
But - whilst that Sun of Life, whom we name Death,
Rose on thy closing, or thy opening sight--
To catch some whisper of thy new delight,
Some earnest of thy fainting soul's surprise,
And see the radiance quickening through the veil
Of palsied speech and leaden-lidded eyes,--
That we, bright Spirit! who stood and watched thee fail 
And sink, and pass through gloom and utter night,
One instant, and no more, would fain have stayed thy flight!</i></b>
