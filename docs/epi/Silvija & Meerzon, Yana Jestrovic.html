                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The exhibit was meant to evoke horror, disgust, and hatred. It had, however, the opposite effect. Thousands of Varsovians, dressed in their holiday best, waiting everyday in lines as long as those to see Lenin's Tomb and in solemn silence looked at the display, listened respectfully to the boogie-woogie, wanting in this way, at least, to manifest their blind and hopeless love for the United States.</i></b>
