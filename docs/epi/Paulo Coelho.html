Therefore I say unto you, 
Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; 
neither for the body, what ye shall put on.
The life is more than meat,
and the body is more than raiment.

Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap;
which neither have storehouse nor barn; 
and God feedeth them: how much more are ye 
better than the fowls? And which of you with 
taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
If ye then be not able to do that thing which is 
least, why take ye thought for the rest?

Consider the lilies how they have grown: they toil not, 
they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</i></b>

Without one thing all will be useless, 
I give you fair warning before you attempt me further, 
I am not what you supposed, but far different. 

Who is he that would become my follower? 
Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections? 
The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, 
perhaps destructive,
 
You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect 
to be your sole and exclusive standard, 
Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting, 
The whole past theory of your life and all conformity 
to the lives around you would have to be abandon’d, 
Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, 
let go your hand from my shoulders, 
Put me down and depart on your way. </i></b>

Zahir, in Arabic, means visible, present, incapable of going unnoticed. It is someone or something which, once we have come into contact with them or it, gradually occupies our every thought, until we can think of nothing else. This can be considered either a state of holiness or of madness.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When you set out on your journey to Ithaca,
pray that the road is long,
full of adventure, full of discovery.
Lestrygonians and the Cyclops,
the angry Poseidon—do not fear them:
You will never find such as these on your path,
if your thoughts remain lofty, if a fine
emotion touches your spirit and your body
Lestrygonians and the Cyclops,
the fierce Poseidon you will never encounter,
if you do not carry them within your soul,
if your heart does not set them up before you.
 
Pray that the road is long.
That the summer mornings are many, when,
with such pleasure, with such joy
you will enter ports seen for the first time;
stop at Phoenician markets,
and purchase fine merchandise,
mother-of-pearl and coral, amber and ebony,
and sensual perfumes of all kinds,
as many sensual perfumes as you can;
visit many Egyptian cities,
to learn and learn from scholars.
 
Always keep Ithaca in your mind.
To arrive there is your ultimate goal.
But do not hurry the voyage at all.
It is better to let it last for many years;
and to anchor at the island when you are old,
rich with all you have gained on the way,
not expecting that Ithaca will offer you riches.
 
Ithaka has given you the beautiful voyage.
Without her you would never have set out on the road.
She has nothing more to give you.
And if you find her poor, Ithaca has not deceived you.
Wise as you have become, with so much experience, 
you must already have understood what Ithacas mean.</i></b>

In their joy, the monks stood in line to pay their respects: one of them recited poetry, another showed her illuminated images from the Bible, another recited the names of all of the saints. At the end of the line was a humble monk who had never had the chance to learn from the wise man of his time. His parents were simple people who worked in a traveling circus. When his turn came, the monks wanted to end the payment of respects, fearful that he would embarrass them. But he too wanted to show his love for the Virgin. Embarrassed, and sensing the disapproval of the brothers, he took some oranges from his pocket and began to toss them in the air -- juggling as his parents in the circus had taught him. It was only then that the infant Jesus smiled and clapped his hands with joy. And it was only to the humble monk that the Virgin held out her arms, allowing him to hold her son for a while.</i></b>
