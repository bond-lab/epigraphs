                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"Rising to the point of order, this one said that since the morgue
was not yet established as the central monument and inspiration of

convivial manner as in the miserable, he claimed for himself, not

so solemn a matter as the misuse of the town pump by witches."</i></b>
