                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The land of scholars and saints;
Scholars and saints my eye, the land of ambush,
Purblind manifestos, never-ending complaints, 
The born martyr and the gallant ninny;
The grocer drunk with the drum,
The land-owner shot in his bed, the angry voices
Piercing the broken fanlight in the slum.</i></b>
