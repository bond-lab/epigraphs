                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We are the stars, who sing / from a distant place. / Yes, you are alone in your orbit, / as we are. / Yes, your light burns fiercely, / as fiercely as ours. / The thin wind of loneliness / may howl around you, / suck the breath from your fire. / But look before you / and behind you. / Look above you / and below you. / See how many other hearts are burning, / burning as brightly as yours. / We are the stars. / We sing with our light / in our vast, brilliant constellations: / alone, / together</i></b>
