                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Nothing would ever make me keep a diary.

Things happen. Time passes. Life begins and goes on and ends, and nothing in all the meaninglessness becomes better just because you write it down and look at it afterwards, One day, everything is going to be over, and if there’s one thing I know it’s that when the soil thuds on to the wooden lid above me there won’t be a soul who wants to read what I did some Monday in March.

Nothing would make me keep a diary.
        Except for one thing.
        The realisation that soon there won’t be anyone around to read it.

Tuesday 25 November.
        There’s snow in the air.
        And fear in everyone’s eyes.</i></b>
