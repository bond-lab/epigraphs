                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Yes, I knew well the world of poverty and ugliness, but I painted the skin, the glittering surface, the appearance of things: the silky ladies, and gentlemen in irreproachable black. I admired how fiercely they fought for a life slightly longer than the one for which they were destined. They protected themselves with fashion, tailors' accessories, a fancy ruffle, ingenious cuffs... any detail that would allow them to last a little longer before they -- and we as well -- are engulfed by the black background.</i></b>
