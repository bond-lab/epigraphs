                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>So if interstellar travel -- traveling between stars and different solar systems -- really is possible for intelligent life to do, why have we not been visited by aliens yet? Well, maybe we have been visited, maybe they're here right now and we just can't perceive them. Or maybe we haven't been discovered. Or maybe we are alone. Or maybe we're just not worth visiting. So what are you waiting for? Live your life in a way that makes traveling light-years just to hang out with you worth it.</i></b>
