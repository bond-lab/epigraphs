                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>JACK WARNER: This Shakespeare stuff ain't bad. I read some this morning and there are parts in English. 
SAM WARNER: It's poison, Jackie. 
HARRY WARNER: We'll lose a fortune. 
SAM WARNER: Ya know the title ain't so bad/. 'Shakespeare.' Sounds like a biopic. 
JACK WARNER: It ain't called 'Shakespeare!'
ALRBERT WARNER: Sam, it's called 'A Midsummer Night's Dream.'
SAM WARNER: Well that'll put us right in the crapper. 
ALBERT WARNER: Maybe we should get a rewrite man. 
HARRY WARNER: Mankiewitz is good. 
ALBERT WARNER: Or Morrison. 
SAM WARNER: Or pay this guy Shakespeare to do it. 
ALRBERT WARNER: He's dead, you idiot. 
SAM WARNER: Then he'll cost us peanuts.</i></b>
