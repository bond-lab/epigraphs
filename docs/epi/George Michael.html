                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine not yours
I may have too much 
But i'll take my chances
Because God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you 
DId you cover your etes when they told you
That He can't come back
Because He has no children to come back for.</i></b>
