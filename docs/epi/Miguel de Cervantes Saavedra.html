                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Love (they say) sometimes flies, sometimes walks, 
runs with one, creeps with another, 
warms a third, burns a fourth,
wounding some, and slaying others. 
In one moment it begins, performs and concludes its career;
lays siege in the morning to a fortress which is surrendered before night,
there being no fortress that can withstand its power.</i></b>
