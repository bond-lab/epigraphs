I'm talking lots of awful boy behaviour, wretched girls, best friends who are missing in action, and ridiculous amounts of elephant poop. This book is not for the faint of heart, or anybody who has recently had a big meal or is suffering from a heinous zit anywhere in the chin region. Oh, and don't read it if you're afraid of snakes. I mean, you shouldn't be afraid of snakes, because they're really nice animals and not at all as terrible as their bad reputations make them out to be. But still.</i></b>
