                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I bought a wood [ . . . ]. It is not a large wood — it contains scarcely any trees, and it is intersected, blast it, by a public footpath. Still, it is the first property that I have owned, so it is right that other people should participate in my shame, and should ask themselves, in accents that will vary in horror, this very important question: What is the effect of property upon the character? [ . . . ]
	If you own things, what’s their effect on you? What’s the effect on me of my wood?
	In the first place, it makes me feel heavy. [ . . . ]
	In the second place, it makes me feel it ought to be larger.</i></b>
