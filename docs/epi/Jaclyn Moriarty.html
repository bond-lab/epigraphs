That day, as the boys were playing, a set of them went to leaping, Sir Isaac, tho' he was little practis'd in the exercise, and at other times outdone by many; yet this day was surprisingly superior to them all, which they much wondered at, but could not discover the reason; which was this: Sir Isaac observed the gusts of wind, and took so proper an advantage of them, as to carry him far beyond the rest...</i></b>

Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold 
The antechapel where the statue stood 
Of Newton with his prism and silent face, 
The marble index of a mind for ever 
Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Winds of Cello are a hoot. I mean that literally. Sometimes they sound exactly like a cross between a car horn and an owl. No, it's more like a car horn and a owl engaged in chat:
Toot hoot.
Hoot toot?
Toot.
Ho-o-t?!
Then, just when you're not expecting it - just when you're sniggering and turning to your books - the Cello Winds switch. Something surges forward like a sailboat on a wave; springs at your heart with claws of gold. The Wind find its feet - or its wings, or its voice - and the music that it sounds! How to describe it? Exquisite does not even come close! 
Try this. I have a friend (Albert) who once suggested that the music of the Winds is "that elusive thing that lies beyond all beauty; the aesthetic heart and soul of grief and love." I'll be honest, I often find Albert quite insufferable, but here, somehow, he almost hits the mark.
Of course, the Cello Winds do more than play their music. They also blow away disease. In our Kingdom, no pestilence takes hold. 
No doubt you'll arrive in Cello determined to hear the Wind. Your determination counts for nothing. Indeed, you could spend a lifetime in Cello and never hear it once. (On the other hand, I am acquainted with a woman [Sophia] who has only ever been to Cello once - and that, very briefly, in transit - yet for the entire fifteen minutes she was regaled by the Winds. So. You know. Go figure.)</i></b>
