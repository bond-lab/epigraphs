                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When the green field comes off like a lid
Revealing what was much better hid--
        Unpleasant:
And look, behind you without a sound
The woods have come up and are standing round
        In deadly crescent.

The bolt is sliding in its groove:
Outside the window is the black remov-
        ers' van:
And now with sudden swift emergence
Come the hooded women, the hump-backed surgeons
        And the Scissor Man.</i></b>
