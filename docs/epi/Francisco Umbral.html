                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Why do I no longer dream about my mother? Perhaps because I have written too much about her, even distributing her beautiful profile on the cover of a book. Without meaning to exorcise anything, I exorcized her presence. My mother wasn't bothering me, I summoned her up myself by writing so much about her, but I suspect that in the end I created a literary character -- complex, artistic, complicated -- and lost the real mother, the dead mother, as a result. I am the orphan of a dead mother because I wrote too much about her.</i></b>
