                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Question -- Are there many booksellers' shops?
James Mudie, Esq. -- I should think there are about half-a-dozen in Sydney.
Question -- What kind of books do you see sold in those shops; is the class of books different from what you see sold in booksellers' shops in London?
James Mudie, Esq. -- Inferior certainly; there are many novels, for instance. I have attended what they call book sales myself, and I have always found that books really valueable have sold for much less than they could have cost in England,  and I remember on one occasion there was a regular noise in the room when the Newgate Calendar was put up, and every person said, 'Ah, I shall have that!'
I forget what it brought, but it brought something enormous... Then they are fond of the history of highwaymen or anything of that kind.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>That is at bottom the only courage that is demanded of us: to have courage for the most strange, the most singular and the most inexplicable that we may encounter. That mankind has in this sense been cowardly has done life endless harm; the experiences that are called 'visions', the whole so-called 'spirit-world', death, all those things that are so closely akin to us, have by daily parrying been so crowded out by life that the senses with which we could have grasped them are atrophied. To say nothing of God.</i></b>

And more, moreover.
