                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Tis now, replied the village belle,
St Mark's mysterious eve,
And all that old traditions tell
I trembingly believe;
How, when the midnight signal tolls,
Along the churchyard green,
A mournful train of sentenced souls
In winding-sheets are seen.
The ghosts of all whom death shall doom
Within the coming year,
In pale procession walk the gloom,
Amid the silence drear.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the free element beneath me swam,
Floundered and dived, in play, in chace, in battle,
Fishes of every colour, form, and kind;
Which language cannot paint, and mariner
Had never seen; from dread Leviathan
To insect millions peopling every wave:
Gather'd in shoals immense, like floating islands,
 Led by mysterious instincts through that waste
And trackless region, though on every side
Assaulted by voracious enemies,
Whales, sharks, and monsters, arm'd in front or jaw,
With swords, saws, spiral horns, or hooked fangs.</i></b>

Thoughts hewn in columns, or in caverned hill,
In honour of their deities and of their dead.</i></b>
