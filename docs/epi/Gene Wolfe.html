                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Aethiopians were clothed in the skins of leopards and lions, and had long bows made of the stem of the palm-leaf, not less than four cubits in length. On these they laid short arrows made of reed, and armed at the tip, not with iron, but with a piece of stone, sharpened to a point, of the kind used in engraving seals. They carried likewise spears, the head of which was the sharpened horn of an antelope; and in addition they had knotted clubs. When they went into battle they painted their bodies, half with chalk and half with vermilion.</i></b>

Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Who treads those level lands of gold,
The level fields of mist and air,
And rolling mountains manifold
And towers of twilight over there?
No mortal foot upon them strays,
No archer in the towers dwells,
But feet too airy for our ways
Go up and down their hills and dells.
The people out of old romance,
And people that have never been,
And those that on the border dance
Between old history and between
Resounding fable, as the king
Who held his court at Camelot.
There Guinevere is wandering
And there the knight Sir Lancelot.
And by yon precipice of white,
As steep as Roncesvalles, and more,
Within an inch of fancy’s sight,
Roland the peerless rides to war.
And just the tip of Quixote’s spear,
The greatest of them all by far,
Is surely visible from here!
But no: it is the Evening Star.</i></b>

Soon he will rise upon fire and fly like the eagle.
We might clasp it to our bellies. That is not the way of hunters, and there are many beds of hide. Send a man to come with us. Send a woman, if it is your custom.
One alone from each town of this new whorl, whether he or she. With us the one you send will return to our old home among the stars.
Send soon. Send one only. We will not delay.
Speak our word to others.</i></b>
