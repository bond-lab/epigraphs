                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave,
that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past,
that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
If a man die, shall he live again?
All the days of my appointed time will I wait,
till my change come.

Thou shalt call,
and I will answer thee:
thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands.
For now thou numberest my steps:
dost thou not watch over my sin?
My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
and thou sewest up mine inquity.

And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought,
and the rock is moved out of his place.
The waters near the stones:
thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth;
and thou destroyest the hope of man.

Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth:
thou changest his countenance and sendest him away.
His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not;
and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
But his flesh upon him shall have pain,
and his soul within him shall mourn.</i></b>
