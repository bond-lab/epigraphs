<li>IN: <i>The Steady Running of the Hour</i> (2014) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"Strange friend," I said, "here is no cause to mourn." 
"None," said the other, "save the undone years,
The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,
Was my life alsol I went hunting wild
After the wildest beauty in the world,
Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,
But mocks the steady running of the hour, 
And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here...</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Strange Meeting</i>,  (1919), Poem, UK
