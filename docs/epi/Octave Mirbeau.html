                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Some minutes later a murmur ran through the crowd.

It was like a burst of immense flowers, like a whirl of fantastic birds.
“The doors, darling!” cried Clara, “the doors are opening! Come, come quickly! And don’t be sad anymore… Think of all the beautiful things you’re gong to see!”</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Torture Garden</i>,  (1899), Novel, France
