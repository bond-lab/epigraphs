                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Wither are fled the charms of vernal grace, and joy's wild gleams that lighten'd o'er thy face? Youth of tumultuous foul, and haggard eye! Thy wafted form, thy hurried steps I view: On thy cold forehead starts the anguishe'd dew; And dreadful was that bosom-rending fight. </i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Monody on the Death of Chatterton</i>,  (1794), Poem, UK
