                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"And yet, believe me, good as well as ill,
Woman's at best a contradiction still.
Heav'n when it strives to polish all it can
Its last best work, but forms a softer man."
"Reserve with frankness, art with truth ally'd;
Courage with softness, modesty with pride:
Fix'd principles, with fancy ever new,
Shake all together and produces-YOU!"</i></b>
