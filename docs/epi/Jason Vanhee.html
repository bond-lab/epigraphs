<li>IN: <i>Engines of the Broken World</i> (2013) Fiction, Young Adult Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>So when this world's compounded union breaks.
Time ends and to old Chaos all things turn; 
Confused stars shall meet, celestial fire
Fleet on the floods, the earth shoulder the sea, 
Affording it no shore, and Phoebe's wain
Chase Phoebus and enraged affect his place, 
And strive to shine by day, and full of strife 
Dissolve the engines of the broken world.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Lucan, translated by Christopher Marlowe</i>,  (1600), Poem, Spain / Italy
