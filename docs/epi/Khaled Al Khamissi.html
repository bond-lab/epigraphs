                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Our Lady, with the infant Jesus in her arms, came down to earth to visit a monastery. In their joy, the monks stood in line to pay their respects: one of them recited poetry, another showed her illuminated images from the Bible, another recited the names of all of the saints. At the end of the line was a humble monk who had never had the chance to learn from the wise man of his time. His parents were simple people who worked in a traveling circus. When his turn came, the monks wanted to end the payment of respects, fearful that he would embarrass them. But he too wanted to show his love for the Virgin. Embarrassed, and sensing the disapproval of the brothers, he took some oranges from his pocket and began to toss them in the air -- juggling as his parents in the circus had taught him. It was only then that the infant Jesus smiled and clapped his hands with joy. And it was only to the humble monk that the Virgin held out her arms, allowing him to hold her son for a while.</i></b>
