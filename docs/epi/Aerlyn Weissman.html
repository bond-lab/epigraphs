                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I remember going into a meeting with a silver anniversary catalog of every film in the Film Board ever made and waving it around saying, "Do you see a listing in the film catalog under 'Gay'? Under 'Homosexual'? No you do not." There was a film that had been about a group of lesbian writers in Quebec, and the catalog described them as Quebecoise writers! Even here the history had been made invisible, and that's a political choice.</i></b>
