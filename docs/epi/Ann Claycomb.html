                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"I know what you want," said the sea witch... "You want to get rid of your fish's tail, and to have two supports instead of it, like human beings on earth, so that the young prince may fall in love with you ... I will prepare a draught for you... Your tail will then disappear, and shrink up into what mankind calls legs, and you will feel great pain, as if a sword were passing through you. But all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw. You will still have the same floating gracefulness of movement, and no dancer will ever tread so lightly; but at every step you take it will feel as if you were treading upon sharp knives, and that the blood must flow. If you will bear all this, I will help you... Put out your little tongue so that I may cut it off as my payment; then you shall have the powerful draught."
"It shall be," said the little mermaid.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The water is wide, I can't swim o'er.
And neither have I wings to fly.
Give me a boat that can carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I.
There is a ship and she sails the sea.
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in.
I know not how to sink or swim.</i></b>
