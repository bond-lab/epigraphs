                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>All my life, no matter where I travel or what adventure I’m living, I hear m mama’s voice in my head, repeating over and over lessons she instilled in me during my youth. Lessons about what it means to be a proper Southern woman— feminine, sweet, charming… and most of all, strong. A handbook, of sorts. She calls these little gems of advice her Georgia Belle Facts— little bits of southern know-how passed down from Southern mothers to their daughters for generations. (Of course, she’s put her own peculiar spin on a few of these southern tenets.) But overall, these facts are about living life to the fullest, with class, dignity and a sense of responsibility to care for our neighbors. Most important, though, her tidbits of wisdom have taught me that the Georgia Belle attitude isn’t really about a particular region of the country. Nor is it about a person’s heritage or financial status. In fact, because of my mama’s tried-and-true advice, I’ve come to learn that the essence of southern spirit is for everyone— no matter who they are or where they live.</i></b>
