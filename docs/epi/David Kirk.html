                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Many people claim that the resolute acceptance of death is the way of the samurai. However, these people are wrong; warriors have no monopoly on this virtue. Monks, women and peasans too can face death bravely. No; the true distinction of a samurai lies in overcoming other men and bringing glory to himself.</i></b>
