                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You should have      
      heard him,   
             his voice was
unforgettable, irresistible, his voice
was an imaginary garden woven through
      with fragrance.

Did you ever have a family?
           Their eyes are closed.
That’s how I know   
      we’re there   
            inside it,
it’s made of sound and steam
that weaves between dark
dining room, bright kitchen.
We’re there because I’m hungry,
and we’ll all be eating soon
together, and the hunger’s sweet.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Song and Dance</i>,  (2002), Poem, US
