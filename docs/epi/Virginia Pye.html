                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In or about December 1910, human character changed. I am not saying that one went out, as one might into a garden, and there saw that a rose had flowered, or that a hen had laid an egg. The change was not sudden and definite like that. But a change there was, nevertheless... All human relations have shifted -- those between masters and servantsm husbands and wives, parents and children. And when human relations change there is at the same time a change in religion, conduct, politics, and literature.</i></b>
