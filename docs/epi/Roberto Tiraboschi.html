                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>But, my dear fellow, nothing in the world that ever you have heard of Venice, is equal to the magnificent and stupendous reality. The wildest visions of the Arabian Nights are nothing to the piazza of Saint Mark, and the first impression of the inside of the Church. The gorgeous and wonderful reality of Venice is beyond the fancy of the wildest dreamer. Opium couldn't build such a place, and enchantment couldn't shadow it forth in a vision. All that I have heard of it, read of it in truth or fiction, fancied of it, is left thousands of miles behind. You know that I am liable to disappointment in such things from over-expectation, but Venice is above, beyond, out of all reach of coming near, the imagination of a man. It has never been rated high enough. It is a thing you would shed tears to see.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Resplendent daughter of the dawn, 
To whom all men bow in love:
Your winds, the sirocco and the bora, 
Are like a breath from heaven above.
Golden lady reigning over us,
O Venice, O Queen, O Venus.</i></b>
