But let our enemies hate you as much as they please, Constantine, provided that they are in terror of you… Certainly to keep one’s foes bound by pardon is more prudent, but it is more courageous to trample them down in their fury.</i></b>

They who insulted God are laid low; they who cast down the holy temple are fallen with greater ruin; and those who tormented the just have poured out their evil souls amidst punishments inflicted by Heaven, and amidst deserved tortures.</i></b>
