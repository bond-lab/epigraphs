Or, playing it like a fish, been happy,

Having felt with fingers that the sky is blue
What have we after that to look forward to? 

Not the twilight of the gods but a precise dawn
Or sallow and grey bricks, and newsboys crying war.</i></b>

The ebony streets with white
And the neon-lamps of London
Stain the canals of night
And the park becomes a jungle
In the alchemy of night.

My wishes turn to violent
Horses black as coal --
The randy mares of fancy,
The stallions of the soul -- 
Eager to take the fences
That fence about my soul.</i></b>

Scholars and saints my eye, the land of ambush,

Piercing the broken fanlight in the slum.</i></b>
