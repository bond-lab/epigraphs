                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Bury me in the trunk of your car.
 I won't be ready to sleep.
 I'll drive underground,
 follow your footsteps around town,
 until I track you down.
 Vanishing and reappearing,
 I'll never be long gone.
 Bury me whereever you are. 
 I don't want to have to search that far. 
 I know a place where we could go,
 where it always snows, 
 but it's never cold there. 
 Vanishing and reappearing,
 I'll never be long gone.</i></b>
