                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Your space and metaphors are large, interactive. / Enough for auroras, two shared bites of that apple / While sitting on up-graded benches. New knowledge / From young, modern journeys to pyramid, Cineplex, / Gender intimacies, tears, laughter, kung-fu fists. / And places in the heart where the spirit wounds itself, / Learning to heal with silence all that and more. / You shift stage and screen into a scouring language / Whose swift nuances multiply the life of James, Dani, / Siva, Darren, Winnine, and those characters that revenge, / We feel their import, the infinitives of their moods, / The neighbours of their thought. And the half-ring of / Famous names, re-told for freshness. Or a point of no / Return when heavy questions gather under one roof. / A goodly cunning that opens earth, fire, air, water. / The unbearable weight of being when one must surely / Tell Laura that I love her, as demanded in the script. And / There are voices in the air telling us what to do, again, / As thoughts gather into Tao, and the many other ways, / Felt by those who dream and write, produce, act, watch / And hear the life beyond the stage, the hall, the ridge, / The edges of our island, as we travel, travelling with you.</i></b>
