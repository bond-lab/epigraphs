                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There’s an inherent limit to the stress that any material can bear. Water has its boiling point, metals their melting points. The elements of the spirit behave the same way. Happiness can reach a pitch so great that any further happiness can’t be felt. Pain, despair, humiliation, disgust, and fear are no different. Once the vessel is full, the world can’t add to it.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Post Office Girl</i>,  (1982), Novel, Austria
