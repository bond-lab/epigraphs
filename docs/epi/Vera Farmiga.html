                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Primarily my research relied heavily on the nonfiction book, The Demonologist . Despite its popularity, I found the book was hard to acquire. It is unlike any book I have ever read. It’s a book about mystical theology. In it, one learns just how and why mystical phenomena occur. It scared the daylights out of me. Profoundly. The preface insists that it is not dangerous to read and that “knowledge is power.” Whatever. I felt a sense of terror every time I cracked it open. I never read the book in the sanctity of my home. I could only read it in flight, funnily enough. Somehow I felt safeguarded in an airplane.</i></b>
