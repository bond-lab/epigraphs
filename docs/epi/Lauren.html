                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Close your unholy lips,
And attend the priest's words as he reads from the Book:
What did He say on the Tuesday?
He told them all to get lost,
And render unto Caesar what was his, and to the Pharisees what was theirs.
Clean the vial from within
Instead of polishing the sides -- thus He spake.
Then will I believe you.</i></b>
