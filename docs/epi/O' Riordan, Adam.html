                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>For this is the real nature of California and the secret of its fascination; this untamed, undomesticated, aloof, prehistoric landscape which relentlessly reminds the traveller of his human condition and the circumstances of his tenure upon the earth. "You are perfectly welcome," it tells him, "during your short visit. Everything is at your disposal. Only, I must warn you, if things go wrong, don't blame me. I accept no responsibility. I am not part of your neurosis. Don't cry to me for safety. There is no home here. There is no security in your mansions or your fortress, your family vaults or your banks or your double beds. Understand this fact, and you will be free. Accept it, and you will be happy.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Exhumations</i>,  (1966), Book, England/US
