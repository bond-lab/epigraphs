                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The prohibition of hurting others internally is, perhaps. not essential to the foundation of societies, because the transgression of that law doth not much alarm plain people. But, where mannners and reÔ¨Åned sentiments prevail, the mind is suceptible of more grievous wounds than the body, and therefore, without that law, a polished society would have no long endurance.</i></b>
