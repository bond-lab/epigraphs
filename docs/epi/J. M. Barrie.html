For a little longer she tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was untrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years came and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes to grow up.</i></b>

One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.</i></b>

"Cave, Peter!"
Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. 
"Come," he cried imperiously, adn soared out at once into the night, followed by John and Michael and Wendy. 
Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery but it was too late. The birds were flown.</i></b>
