                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Little Charles, sleep sweetly in peace, 
Soon enough you must wake
Soon enough see our evil time
And taste it's gall. 
The World is an island of sorrow
As soon as you breathe you must die
And stay behind as earth.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Lullaby for My Son Carl</i>,  (1787), Song, Sweden
