                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>But Evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision, that faintly floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on through the moonlight. It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom. Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel wandered before her, and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer.</i></b>
