A girl in a red hat, a woman in blue
Reading a letter, a lady weighing gold ... 
If I could say this to you so you saw,
And knew, and agreed that this is how it was
In a lost city across the sea of years,
I think we should be for one moment happy
In the great reckoning of those little rooms...</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>After Alice</i> (2015) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the
hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all
the time she went on talking : “ Dear, dear !
How queer everything is to-day ! And yesterday
things went on just as usual. I wonder if
I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think:
was I the same when I got up this morning?
I almost think I can remember feeling a little
different. But if I ’m not the same, the next
question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s
the great puzzle !” And she began thinking over
all the children she knew, that were of the
same age as herself, to see if she could have
been changed for any of them.
“I’m sure I ’m not Ada,” she said, “ for her
hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t
go in ringlets at all ; and I ’m sure I can ’t be
Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,
oh! she knows such a very little ! Besides, she’s
she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it
all is !</i></b>
