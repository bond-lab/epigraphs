                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Her earlier youth seemed as strange to her as a disease of life. Little by little she had emerged and discovered that one could even live without happiness, and in abolishing happiness she had encountered a legion of invisible people nearby, who lived as one works -- with perseverance, determination, and joy. What had happened to Ana before having a family was forever beyond her reach: an unsettled exaltation that had so often been confused with an unstainable elation. In exhange she had finally created something she could understand -- an adult life. And thus it was as she had wanted and chosen.</i></b>
