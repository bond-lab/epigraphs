 I send you love on the wings of a bee
 That jar of honey on your doorstep came from me
 It promises sweetness we both can share,
 And maybe, just maybe, you can learn to share
 
 I bare my arm to the pain of stings,
 To claim the prize that my daring brings
 I'll give my heart just as eagerly
 If one day you'll give yours to me.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Into the forge's fiery glow I thrust the steel
And bend it into the arc of a wheel.
My hammer strikes; my muscles ache.
This is how I make what I make.

My dearest works with the stuff of dreams
Where nothing seen is what it seems.
Her image flickers, and people sigh.
How can she love my kind of guy?

Still she trembles when we kiss.
Is there hope for a match like this?</i></b>
