                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When moon and sun stand each in place / And your opponent takes the field, / Look past him to the one you'll face / When all hid truths stand new-revealed. / When that time comes, your only shield / Will be the outward gaze toward space; / The cold will show what sword to wield / Against the fire's and death's embrace. / Still, though your oldest foe should yield, / Beware the last fall of the dice: / Though now an ancient sorrow's healed, / Beware who pays the final price — / And do not miss, 'twixt fire and ice, / Your chance to make the sun rise twice.</i></b>

From the straigtened circle | and the shortened night,
When the blue star rises | and the water burns:
Then the word long-lost | comes again to light
To be spoke by the watcher | who silent yearns
For the lost one found. Yet to wreak aright,
She must slay her rival | and the First World spurn
Lest the one departed | no more return.</i></b>

On kindling thus the Scorpion, his tail
Portending evil and his claws aflame?...
Why planets leave their paths and through the void
Thus journey on obscure? 'Tis war that comes,
Fierce rabid war: the sword shall bear the rule...</i></b>
