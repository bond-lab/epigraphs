                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A is building with building-stones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. It has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words "block", "pillar", "slab", "beam". A calls them out ; - B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call. - Conceive this as a primitive language.</i></b>
