                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>mi familia y mis mejores amigos
And they’ve opened your sides to cover their stench
And they’ve beaten you because you are always stone
And they’ve thrown you to the abyss so as not to hear
your voice of fire
And they’ve wounded you
And they’ve killed you
And so
they’ve abandoned you like an animal
like the king of any desert
except this one</i></b>
