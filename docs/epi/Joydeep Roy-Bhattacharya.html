                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I know that I must die,
E'en hadst thou not proclaimed it; and if death
Is thereby hastened, I shall count it gain.
For death is gain to him whose life, like mine, 
Is full of misery. Thus my lot appears
Not sad, but blissful; for had I endured
To leave my mother's son unburied there,
I should have grieved with reason, but not now.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Antigone</i>,  (-441), Play, Greece
