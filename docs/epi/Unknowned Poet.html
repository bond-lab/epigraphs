                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Imprisoned in here for a long, long time, 
We know we're punished tho' we;ve committed no crime,
Our thoughts are gloomy and enthusiasim damp. 
To be locked up in a concentration camp. 

Loyalty we know and Patriotism we feel, 
To sacrifice our utmost was our ideal 
To fight for our country, and die mayhap; 
Yet we're here because we happen to be a JAP. 

We all love life, and our country best, 
Our misfortune to be here in the West, 
To keep us penned behind that DAMNED FENCE
Is someone's notion of NATIONAL DEFENCE!!!!!
DAMNED FENCE! </i></b>
