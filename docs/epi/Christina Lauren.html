                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A slumber did my spirit seal
I had no human fears: 
She seem'd a thing that could not feel
The touch of earthly years. 
No motion has she now, no force; 
She neither haers no sees; 
Roll'd round in earth's diurnal course, 
With rocks, and stones, and trees.</i></b>
