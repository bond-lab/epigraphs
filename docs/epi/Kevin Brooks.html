<li>IN: <i>A Dance of Ghosts</i> (2011) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I will dance
The dance of dying days
And sleeping life.

I will dance
In cold, dead leaves
A bending, whirling human flame.

I will dance
As the Horned God rides
Across the skies.

I will dance
To the music of His hounds
Running, baying in chorus.

I will dance
With the ghosts of those
Gone before.

I will dance
Between the sleep of life
And the dream of death.

I will dance
On Samhainâ€™s dusky eye,
I will dance.</i></b>
