                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The sow came in with the saddle.
The little pig rocked the cradle.
The dish jumped over the table
To see the pot swallow the ladle.
The spit that stood behind the door
Threw the pudding-stick on the floor.
“Odsplut!” said the gridiron,
“Can’t you agree?
I’m the head constable,
Bring them to me!”</i></b>
