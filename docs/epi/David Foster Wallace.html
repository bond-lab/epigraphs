That I drifted and quit because nothiing meant anything, no one, choice, was really better. That I was, in a way, too free, or tha t this kind of freedom wasnt actually real - I was free to choose 'whatever'because it didnt really matter. But that this, too, was because of something I chose - I had somehow chosen to have nothing matter... The point was that through making this choice, I didnt matter - even just to myself - I would have to be less free, by deciding to choose in some kind of definite way. Even if it was nothing more than an act of will.</i></b>
