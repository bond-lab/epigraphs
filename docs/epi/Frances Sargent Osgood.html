                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My first meeting with the poet was at the Astor House... With his proud and beautiful head erect, his dark eyes flashing with the elective light of feeling and of thought, a peculiar, an inimitable blending of sweetness and hauteur in his expression and manner, he greeted me, calmly, gravely, almost coldly; yet with so marked an earnestness that I could not help being deeply impressed by it. From that moment until his death we were friends... I maintained a correspondence with Mr. Poe, in accordance with the earnest entreaties of his wife, who had imagined that my influence over him had a restraining and beneficial effect.</i></b>
