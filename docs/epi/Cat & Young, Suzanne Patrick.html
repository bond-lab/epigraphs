                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>No trees in sight, just concrete
Still I see
Two roads twist and turn; twist and turn, in front of me
There's no signs, but screams
Which way's reality?

So you choose; yeah, you choose
Maby; maby, you lose
the morning's coming soon
Sidewalk paved on hitches
Broken hearts not fixed by stitches
But morning's coming soon

No right in sight, just questions
And you find
There's no map to Mecca
It's just life
No right answer; perfect marks
It's no big deal; it's just your heart
Falling stars, lightning sparks
This will only sting a bit

We are all
Magnets for fate
stumbling, skipping, running at our pace
Making choices, losing voices
Making wishes for forgiveness
Morning's coming soon

And no matter where you sit, how fast you sip
The coffee tastes the same on magnet lips</i></b>
