                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>At Prince of Plums shall prelate oppose
A foun of three feathers with flaunting of fur,
Long castle will collar and cast out the core,
His reign to fall ruin, mors regis to roar.
     By bank of a bishop shall butchers abide,
To nest, by God's name, with knives in hand,
Then springen in service at spiritus sung.
     In palace of prelate with pearls all appointed,
By kingmaker's cunning a king to unking,
A magnate whose majesty mingles with mort.
     By Half-ten of Hawks might shender be shown.
On day of Saint Dunstan shall Death have his doom.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Thirteenth Prophecy, from Liber De Mortibus Regum Anglorum ("Book of the Deaths of English Kings")</i>,  (2014), Fictional, NULL
