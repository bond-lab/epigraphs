<li>IN: <i>Madame X (La Femme X)</i> (1908) Fiction, French
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Oh, Spring of days long ago, blooming and bright,
Far have you fluttered away!
No more the skies azure light, caroling birds
Waken and glisten for me!

Bearing all joy from my heart—Loved one!
How far from my life hast thou flown!
Vainly to me does the springtime return!

It brings thee never again—Dark is the sun!
Dead are the days of delight!
Cold is my heart and as dark as the grave!
Life is in vain—evermore</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>ELEGIE

(From the French of Massenet)</i>,  (None), Poem, France
