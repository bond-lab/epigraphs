                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>a territory, a progeny, 
a spitting image
like Athena sprung

from her father's head:
chip off the old block,
issue and spawn;

a namesake, a wishbone -- 
loyalist and traitor -- 
a native, an other, 

a subject, a study,
a history, a half blood,
a continent dark and strange.</i></b>
