                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Far off, far down, some fisherman is watching
 As the rod dips and trembles over the water,
 Some sheperd rests his weight upon his crook,
 Some ploughman on the handles of the ploughshare,
 And all look up, in absolute amazement,
 At those airborne above. They must be gods!</i></b>
