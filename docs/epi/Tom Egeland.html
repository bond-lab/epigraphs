                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>These are the secret words, which the living Jesus spoke and which Didymus Judas Thomas wrote down. 
Jesus said: He who shall find the interpretation of these words
shall not taste of death. He who seeks, let him not cease
seeking until he finds; and when he finds
he will be troubled, and when he is troubled
he will be amazed, and he will reign over the All.</i></b>
