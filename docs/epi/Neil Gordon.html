                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Hush little baby 
My poor little thing 
You've been shuffled about 
Like a pawned wedding ring 
It must seem strange 
Love was here then gone 
And the Oklahoma sunrise
Becomes the Amarillo dawn 
What's important in this life? 
Ask the man 
Who's lost his wife</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept my off-a my feet
And I'm back in the rain, oh, oh
And you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now.</i></b>
