                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And afterward? What happened afterward?... The way that a great experience comes to an end? A melancholy topic, for a revolt is a great experience, an adventure of the heart... But there comes a moment when the mood burns out and everything ends. As a matter of reflex, out of custom, we go on repeating the gestures and the words and want everything to be the way it was yesterday, but we know already -- and the discovery appalls us -- that this yesterday will never again return... We look uncomfortable into each other's eyes, we shy away from conversation, we stop being any use to one another.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Shah of Shahs</i>,  (1982), Book, Poland
