                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>If I might give a short hint to an impartial writer, It would be to tell him his fate. If he resolves to venture upon the dangerous precipice of telling unbiassed truth, let him proclaim war with mankindâ€” neither to give nor to take quarter. If he tells the crimes of great men, they fall upon him with the iron hands of the law ; if he tells them of their virtues, when they have any, then the mob attacks him with slander. But if he regards truth, let him expect martyrdom on both sides, and then he may go on fearless; and this is the course I take myself.</i></b>
