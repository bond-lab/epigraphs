                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"This apparatus," said the Officer, grasping a connecting road and leaning against it, "is our previous Commandant's invention... Have you heard of our previous Commandant? No? Well, I'm not claiming too much when I say that the organization of the entire penal colony is his work. We, his friends, already knew at the time of his death that the administration of the colony was so self-contained that even if his successor had a thousand new plans in mind he would not be able to alter anything of the old plan, at least not for several years... It's a shame that you didn't know the old Commandant!"</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And what of the Grail, that mysterious object that all the knights-errant were utlimately seeking? Oddly enough, Richard Wagner, composer of the opera Parzifal, first suggested that the Grail was a symbol inspired by the new forms of finance. Where earlier epic heroes sought after, and fought over, piles of real, concrete fold and silver - the Nibelung's hoard - these new ones, born of the new commercial economy, pursued purely abstract forms of value. No one, after all knew precisely what the Grail was... Marc Shell even suggested that it would best be conceived as a blank check, the ultimate financial abstraction.</i></b>
