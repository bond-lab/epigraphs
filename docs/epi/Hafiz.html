You on a slave block
And the unreal bought
You

Now I keep coming to your owner
Saying, 
"This one is mine."
You often overhear us talking
And this can make your heart leap
With excitement.

Don't worry,
I will not let sadness
Possess you. 

I will gladly borrow all the gold
I need

To get you
Back.</i></b>
