                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There are in our existence spots of time, / That with distinct pre-eminence retain / A renovating virtue, whence - depressed / By false opinion and contentious thought, / Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight, / In trivial occupations, and the round / Of ordinary intercourse - our minds / Are nourished and invisibly repaired; / A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced, / That penetrates, enables us to mount, / When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Prelude</i>,  (1799), Poem, UK
