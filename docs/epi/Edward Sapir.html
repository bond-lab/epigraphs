                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Human beings do not live in the objective world alone... but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society... The fact of the matter is that the "real world" is to a large extent unconsciously built upon the language habits of the group. No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality.</i></b>
