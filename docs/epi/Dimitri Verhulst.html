He doesn't know that behind the God that will save him, the one he beseeches, there is another God he cannot see. Is there another behind ours as well? The dog grovels at my feet. At whose feet must we grovel?</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Why do I no longer dream about my mother? Perhaps because I have written too much about her, even distributing her beautiful profile on the cover of a book. Without meaning to exorcise anything, I exorcized her presence. My mother wasn't bothering me, I summoned her up myself by writing so much about her, but I suspect that in the end I created a literary character -- complex, artistic, complicated -- and lost the real mother, the dead mother, as a result. I am the orphan of a dead mother because I wrote too much about her.</i></b>
