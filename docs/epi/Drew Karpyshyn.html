                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>All things are born from fire. The flames of Chaos are the source of all life and all creation; the cause of all death and all destruction. The entirety of the mortal world was forged from the inferno of the Burning Sea, the Chaos shaped and bound by the power of the Old Gods to create an island of tranquility floating in an ocean of flame. 
First came the plants and trees. Next came the fish of the oceans, then the birds of the air and the beasts of the land. Finally, the Old Gods created woman and man, and they spread out to populate the newly formed world. 
But Chaos rebels against structure and order, and even the magic of a God cannot bind it forever. Nothing is eternal.</i></b>
