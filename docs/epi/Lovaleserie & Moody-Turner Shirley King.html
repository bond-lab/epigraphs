                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>But whether an author protested Jim Crow directly or strived to produce a work in which race didn't matter, what made African American literature a literature was the historical circumstance in which black literary achievement could cound, almost automatically, as an effort on behalf of the "race" as a whole. That circumstance was Jim Crow or legalised segregation. We are no longer in that moment. Nothing makes the work of any individual black writer a matter for the "race" as a whole.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>c Black writers started reading and revising each other's works, situating their representations of their own experiences and those of other black people, in the tropes and metaphors of other black writers. That is what a literary tradition is: it is a body of texts defined by signifying relations of revision. Like it or not, black literature, because of this, is here to stay. </i></b>
