                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When to the sessions of sweet silent thought 
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, 
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste: 
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow, 
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night, 
And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe, 
And moan the expense of many a vanished sight: 
Then can I greive at greivances foregone, 
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'ver 
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan, 
Which I new pay as if not paid before. 
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend, 
All losses are restored and sorrows end.</i></b>
