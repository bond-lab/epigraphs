                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>...In addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche... there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals. This collective unconscious does not develop individually but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms... which give definite form to certain pyschic contents.</i></b>

"The Christian myth, possibly."
"Do you live it?" I asked myself.
"If I am truthful the answer is no. It is not what I live by."
"So we no longer live by myth?"
"Apparently not."
"What is your myth then -- the myth by which you lived?"</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The universal hero myth, for example, always refers to a powerful man or God-man who vanquishes evil in the form of dragons, serpents, demons and so on, and who liberates his people from destruction and death. The narration or ritual repetition of sacred texts and ceremonies, and the worship of such a figure with dances, music, hymns, prayers and sacrifices, grip the audiences with numinous emotions (as with magic spells) and exalt the individual to an identification with the hero.</i></b>
