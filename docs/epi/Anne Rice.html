                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Tragic rabbit, a painting. 
The caked ears green like rolled corn. 
The black forehead pointing at the stars. 
A painting on my wall, alone
as rabbits are 
and aren't. Fat red cheek, 
all Art, trembling nose, 
a habit hard to break as not.

You too can be a tragic rabbit; green and red 
your back, blue your manly little chest. 
But if you're ever goaded into being one 
beware the True Flesh, it

will knock you off your tragic horse 
and break your tragic colors like a ghost 
breaks marble; your wounds will heal 
so quickly water

will be jealous. 
Rabbits on white paper painted 
outgrow all charms against their breeding wild; 
and their rolled corn ears become horns.

So watch out of the tragic life feels fine - 
caught in that rabbit trap 
all colors look like sunlight's swords, 
and scissors like The Living Lord.</i></b>

Carving a swan in a block of ice
