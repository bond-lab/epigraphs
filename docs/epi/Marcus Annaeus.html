                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>...Mars, why art thou bent
On kindling thus the Scorpion, his tail
Portending evil and his claws aflame?...
Why planets leave their paths and through the void
Thus journey on obscure? 'Tis war that comes,
Fierce rabid war: the sword shall bear the rule...</i></b>
