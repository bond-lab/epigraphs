                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"What do you know about this business?" the King said to Alice. "Nothing," said Alice. "Nothing whatever?" persisted the King. "Nothing whatever," said Alice. "That's very important," the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: "Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course," he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke. "Unimportant, of course, I meant," the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, "important--unimportant--unimportant--important" as if he were trying which word sounded best.</i></b>
