                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Where'er the sun before them shone,
And paved the world with gold,
They passed. Round Earth's most favoured zone
Their chief his turban rolled.
From Hagar's desert, Ishmael's plains,
To Ocean's western fold.
They reared their crescent-crowned fanes,
And cloistered fountains cold.</i></b>
