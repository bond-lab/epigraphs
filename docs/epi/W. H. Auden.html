Italian shore, his Terrible Demon arose 
Over his shoulder; he wept to himself in the night, 
A dirty landscape-painter who hated his nose. 

The legions of cruel inquisitive They 
Were so many and big like dogs; he was upset 
By Germans and boats; affection was miles away; 
But guided by tears his successfully reached his Regret. 

How prodigious the welcome was. Flowers took his hat
And bore him off to introduce him to the tongs; 
The demon's false nose made the table laugh; a cat
Soon had him waltzing madly, let him squeeze her hand, 
Words pushed him to the piano to sing comic songs. 

And children swarmed to him like seeders. He became a land.</i></b>

Over the tea-cups and in the square the tongue has its desire;
Still waters run deep, my dear, there's never smoke without fire.

Behind the corpse in the reservoir, behind the ghost on the links,
Behind the lady who dances and the man who madly drinks,
Under the look of fatigue, the attack of migraine and the sigh
There is always another story, there is more than meets the eye.

For the clear voice suddenly singing, high up in the convent wall,
The scent of the elder bushes, the sporting prints in the hall,
The croquet matches in summer, the handshake, the cough, the kiss,
There is always a wicked secret, a private reason for this.</i></b>

Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.

He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.

The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;
For nothing now can ever come to any good.

Revealing what was much better hid -
Unpleasant:
And look, behind you without a sound
The woods have come up and are standing round
In deadly crescent.

The bolt is sliding in its groove;
Outside the window is the black remov-
-ers' van;
And now with sudden swift emergence
Come the hooded women, the hump-backed surgeons,
And the Scissor Man.</i></b>

impossible yet useful numbers, no one
has yet explained. Still, they do
managed to forgive impossible behavior,
to endure by some mircale

conversational tics and larval habits
without wincing...

The ogre will come in any case:
so Joyce has warned us. Howbeit,
fasting or feasting, we both know this: without
the Spirit we die, but life

without the Letter is in the worst of taste,
and always, though truth and love
can never really differ, when they seem to, 
the subaltern should be truth.</i></b>
