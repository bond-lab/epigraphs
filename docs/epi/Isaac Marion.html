                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>You have known, O Gilgamesh, 
What interests me, 
To drink from the Well of Immortality.
Which means to make the dead
Rise from their graves
And the prisoners from their cells
The sinners from their sins.
I think love's kiss kills our heart of flesh.
It is the only way to eternal life, 
Which should be unbearable if lived
Among the dying flowers
And the shrieking farewells
Of the overstretched arms of our spoiled hopes.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Gilgamesh: A Verse Narrative</i>,  (1971), Poem, Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq/Turkey/Syria)
