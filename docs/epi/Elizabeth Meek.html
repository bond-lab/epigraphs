                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Vain are his thoughts, his hopes are lost ! How soon his mem'ry dies ! His name is written in the dust, Where his own carcase lies. Men void of wisdom and of grace, If honour raise them high, Live, like the beast, a thoughtless race, And like the beast they die.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Psalms of David</i>,  (1744), Religious Text, UK
