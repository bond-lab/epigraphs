                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We from the bridge’s head descended, where
To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm
Opening to view, I saw a crowd within
Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape
And hideous, that remembrance in my veins
Yet shrinks the vital current…
Amid this dread exuberance of woe
Ran naked spirits wing’d with horrid fear,
Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,
Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Divine Comedy, Inferno
Canto xxiv</i>,  (1472), Poem, Italy
