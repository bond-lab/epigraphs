                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Is the dust a problem? Yes. Do we have a moral imperative to do something about it? Absolutely. If we act now, will it be of benefit to the majority in the future, greater than the harm it could do at this present time? Well, there's a question worth the asking.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>They say that the soul of the city is being ripped apart. 
 I've never had much time for 'them'and the things 'they' say but, for one, I find myself forced to agree. It begins with a rusting, a place where new foundations were laid and which are now turned to orange-brown. Then a cracking, the road beneath your feet splitting through the tarmac is fresh. Then a dripping, the water coming through from the pipes overhead, then a creaking, wood splinters against wood, glass breaks and someone may leave a bin bag behind the pane to keep out the draught but that is all, and it is forgotten, and it withers, and it dies. people don't understand how a city dwindles like a living thing, but that is what it is and, like all things that live, it too can die. 
 And this shaking, this crumbling, this death by little silences falling in busy streets, this hollowness of all things - I am powerless to prevent.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Don't tell me there's something wrong with the kids. Because then you gotta tell me that the kids have been screwed up by the schools, and the schools are being screwed over by the parents. Then the parents -- they got screwed over by their jobs, by an economy that doesn't function, and the economy, that got messed up by the politicans, and the politicians, they get messed up by the press, and the press got screwed over by the punters, who got picked on by the banks, and before you know it, the problem is everyone who ever took out a tenner when they should have put a fiver into their savings account and took out a loan instead of a pension, and then -- then it's humanity that's the problem. It's the nature of what we are; it's the messed-up thing that sometimes gets called the human soul. You really going to do a fix on that?</i></b>

The dude who is in the know, the one who sees what the kids are too dumb to look at. To put it in little words so as you'll understand - your half-decent shaman always knows where the nearest public bog is, and if it's worth legging it for the bus.</i></b>
