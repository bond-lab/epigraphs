                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There is within every man and woman a core of evil only lightly held in check. Whether we call it savagery, brutality or barbarism; whether we give it some scientific-sounding label such as sadism or psychosis; whether we ascribe it to amorality or the Devil himself, it is, nevertheless, mankind's constant companion. Most of the time it sleeps, invisible and unheeded, within our breasts, and we call ourselves civilised and pretend it is not there. But only give us cause to wake the beast -- give us unlimited power, for example, over our fellow man, and tell us there will be no repercussions from exercising it -- and we will every one of us prove capable of acts more terrible than the imagination can conceive. 
And each time we will wake, as if from a dream, saying "Never again", and each time we will lie.</i></b>
