                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It flows through old hushed Egypt and its sands,
Like some grave, mighty thought, threading a dream;
And times, and things, as in that vision seem,
Keeping, along it, their eternal stands,
Caves, pillars, pyramids, the shepherd bands,
That roamned through the young earth;- the flag extreme
Of high Sesostris, and that southern beam,
The laughing Queen that caught the world's great hands.
Then comes a mightier silence, stern and strong,
As of a world left empty of its throng;
And the void weighs on us: and then to wake,
And hear the fruitful stream lapsing along,
'Twixt villages, and think how we shall take
Our own calm journey on, for human sake.</i></b>
