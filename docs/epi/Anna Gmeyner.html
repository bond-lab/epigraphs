                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Every moment grows, like a plant with tangled, hidden roots, out of the soil of the past, and is invisibly shaped by it. What these children had suffered, uncomprehendingly, reached back further than their memories, back into the time before they existed and before their lives began. 
And even that was not the beginning.</i></b>
