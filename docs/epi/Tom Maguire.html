                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Sing a song of England,
Shuddering with cold,
Doomed to slow starvation,
By the gods of gold,
See her famished children,
Hunger-marked, and mean,
Isn't that a dainty dish,
To lay before the Queen?

Mammon in the counting house,
Counting out the money,
His lady in the parlour,
Eating bread and honey.
The worker on te highway,
Short of food and clothes -- 
God bless happy England!
And save her from her foes.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>A New Nursery Rhyme</i>,  (1893), Song, UK
