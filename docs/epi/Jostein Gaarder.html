                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Joy is a butterfly
Fluttering low over the earth,
But sorrow is a bird
With big, strong, black wings.
They lift you high above life
Flowing below in sunlight and growth.
The bird of sorrow flies high
To where the angels of grief keep watch
Over death's lair.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>A poem from her notebook written when she was sixteen years old</i>,  (1908), Poem, Finland
