                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The cards
Fall
Luck falls
From one
To another
On and over
A face falls
The eyes fall
Under the table
And over ...
The players
Shout
And God
Is silent
Smiling to see that
Now
Clubs are trumps
Luck falls
Under the table
And over

And God 
Is silent
And smiles
Tormented
At man falling
From living by the cards
To death by cards
Silent
Unyielding
And over</i></b>
