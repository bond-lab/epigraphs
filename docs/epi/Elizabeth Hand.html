Dead flesh to rise from darkness
And live a second time;
Lest murder cheaply mended
Invite men’s hands to crime…</i></b>

of the years shows it to me.
But Destiny arrived
in some haste and stopped them.
The beautiful life was brief.
But how potent were the perfumes,
on how splendid a bed we lay,
to what sensual delight we gave our bodies.
An echo of the days of pleasure,
an echo of the days drew near me,
a little of the fire of the youth of both of us;
again I took in my hands a letter,
and I read and reread till the light was gone.
And melancholy, I came out on the balcony—
came out to change my thoughts at least by looking at
a little of the city that I loved,
a little movement on the street, and in the shops.</i></b>

These Screech-owles fethers, and this prickling bryer,

That all thy feares and cares an end may have.

Melt her hard heart with your melodious sound.
In vaine are all the charmes I can devise:
She hath an Arte to breake them with her eyes.</i></b>
