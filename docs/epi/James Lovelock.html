                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It took the view of the earth from space... to let us sense a planet on which living things, the air, the oceans, and the rocks all combine in one as Gaia. The name of the super-organism, Gaia, is not a synonym for the biosphere... Just as teh shell is part of a snail, so the rocks, the air, and the oceans are a part of Gaia. Gaia, as we shall see, has continuity with the past back to the origins of life, and extends into the future as long as life persists.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Earth may be alive: not as the ancients saw her -- a sentient Goddess with a purpose and foresight -- but alive like a tree. A tree that quietly exists, never moving except to sway in the wind, yet endlessly conversing with the sunlight and the soil. Using sunlight and water and nutrient minerals to grow and change. But all done so imperceptibly, that to me the old oak tree on the green is the same as it was when I was a child.</i></b>
