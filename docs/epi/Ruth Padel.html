                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>They will charge us with having culpably allowed the destruction of some of those records of Creation we had it in our power to conserve. And, while professing to regard every living thing as the direct handiwork and best evidence of a Creator, yet, with a strange inconsistency, seeing many of them perish irrevocably from the face of the earth.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>This is where the serpent lives, the bodiless.
His head is air. Beneath his tip at night
Eyes open and fix on us in every sky.

Or is this another wriggling out of the egg,
Another image at the end of the cave,
Another bodiless for the body's slough?

This is where the serpent lives. This is his nest,
These fields, these hills, these tinted distances,
And the pines above and along and beside the sea.</i></b>
