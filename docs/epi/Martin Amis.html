                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Round about the cauldron go;
In the poisoned entrails throw:
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights hast thirty-one
Sweltered venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i’ the charmed pot. .
Fillet of a fenny snake
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt, and toe of frog,
Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,
Adder’s fork, and blind-worm’s sting,
Lizard’s leg, and howlet’s wing. .
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witches’ mummy, maw and gulf
Of the ravined salt sea shark,
Root of hemlock digged i’ the dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Gall of goat, and slips of yew
Silvered in the moon’s eclipse,
Nose of Turk, and Tartar’s lips,
Finger of birth-strangled babe,
Ditch-delivered by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab. .
Cool it with a baboon’s blood;
Then the charm is firm and good.
I am in blood
Stepped in so far, that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o’er.</i></b>

Yet what is frightening is that the departing world leaves behind it, not an heir, but a pregnant widow. Between the death of the one and the birth of the other, much water will flow by, a long night of chaos and desolation will pass.</i></b>
