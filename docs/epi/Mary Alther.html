                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The borderline between the oral and the written is the subject of the 1001 Nights. The stories that Sheherezade told Sharyar and Dinarzad in the royal bed were collected and written by the calligrapher who bound them in a book and who reflected on what he was doing while he wrote, which is why all of the 1001 Nights are pierced by the anxiety of leaving traces and nostalgia for the act of pure fancy that the calligrapher was destroying as he wrote.</i></b>
