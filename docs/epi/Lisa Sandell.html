                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Lying, robed in snowy white
That loosely flew to left and right–
The leaves upon her falling light–
Thro’ the noises of the night
She floated down to Camelot;
And as the boat-head wound along
The willowy hills and fields among,
They heard her singing her last song,
The Lady of Shalott. </i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>"The Lady of Shalott"</i>,  (1833), Poem, UK
