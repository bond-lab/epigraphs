                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>ROMANY CURSE
He must lie with his treasures, be they tin or gold.
Resting in finery, his back to the soil.
One wheel of his vargon must light up with fire.
In the flame is the evil, his pain and his soul.
But beware of his talisman, carved out of stone.
If not in his palm, then a curse is foretold.
For who steals the charm of a dukkerinâ€˜s son,
Will walk in his shadow, bleed with his blood,
Cry loud with his anguish and suffer his pain.
His unquiet spirit will rise up again,
His footsteps will echo unseen on the ground
Until the curse is fulfilled, the talisman found.</i></b>
