                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There's a quaint little place they call Lullaby Town - 
It's just back of those hills where the sunsets go down.
Its streets are of silver, its buildings of gold, 
And its palaces dazzling things to behold. 

There's a peddler who carries, strapped high on his back, 
A bundle. Now, guess what he has in that pack.
No, he's not peddling james nor delectable creams.
Would you know what he's selling? Just wonderful dreams!</i></b>
