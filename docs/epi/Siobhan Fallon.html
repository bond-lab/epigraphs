                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>She turned to descend the stair, her heart 
in tumult. Had she better keep her distance
and question him, her husband? Should she run
up to him, take his hands, kiss him now?

... And she, for a long time, sat deathly still
in wonderment -- for sometimes as she gazed 
she found him -- yes, clearly -- like her husband, 
but sometimes blood and rags were all she saw.</i></b>
