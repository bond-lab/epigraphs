I don't have any caps left made back home
Nor any shoes that trod your roads
I've worn out your last shirt quite long ago
It was of Sile cloth
Now only you remain in the whiteness of my hair
In the lines of my forehead
My country</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Today is Sunday.
Today they let me out into the sun for the first time
And for the first time in my life
I stood immovable
Amazed at how distant the sky was
How vast,
How blue
Respectfully I sat down on the ground
Leaned my back against the wall
At this moment
No falling into revolting waves at all
At this moment no thoughts
Of struggle
Of freedom
Of my wife.
The soil, the sun and me...
I am happy.</i></b>
