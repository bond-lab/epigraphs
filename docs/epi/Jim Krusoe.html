                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Somewhere someone is traveling furiously toward you,
At incredible speed, traveling day and night,
through blizzards and desert heat, across torrents,
through narrow passes.
But will he know where to find you,
Recognize you when he sees you,
Give you the thing he has for you?</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>The Sleep Garden</i> (2016) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There are nights when I awake from a terrible nightmare, my simplest and most frightening dream. I am lying in a deep sleep in the bed I lay down in that evening. The setting and the time are the same as the actual setting and time. If the nightmare begins at midnight, for instance, it places me in precisely the degree of darkness and silence reigning at that hour. I can see and feel my position; I know the bed and room I am sleeping in. My dream stretches like a fine skin over my body and over the state of my sleep at the moment. One might even say I am awake. I am awake though asleep and dreaming my wakefulness at the same moment I am dreaming my sleep.</i></b>

Comme il pleut sur la ville.
Quelle est cette langueur 
Qui penetre mon coeur?

It rains in my heart
As it rains on the town
What is this sadness
That creeps into my heart?</i></b>
