not only the beds you lay on,
but also thosedesires glowing openly
in eyes that looked at you
trembling for you in voices --
only some chance obstacle frustrated them

it seems almostas if you gave yourself 
to those desires too -- how they glowed
remember, in eyes that looked at you,
remember body, how they trembled for you in those voices</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>As you set out for Ithaka 
hope your road is a long one, 
full of adventure, full of discovery. 
Laistrygonians, Cyclops, 
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them...
Keep Ithaka always in your mind. 
Arriving there is what you’re destined for. 
But don’t hurry the journey at all. 
Better if it lasts for years, 
so you’re old by the time you reach the island, 
wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way, 
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich. 

Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey. 
Without her you wouldn't have set out. </i></b>
