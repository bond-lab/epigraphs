                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old wall; not so high but that I could . . . see . . that Estella was walking away from me even then. But she seemed to be everywhere . . . She had her back towards me, and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never looked round, and passed out of my view directly . . . I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she were going out into the sky.</i></b>
