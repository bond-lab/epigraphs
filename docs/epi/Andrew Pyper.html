                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I've died more than once in my life. 
Some can spin plates on sticks, some can go around Pebble Beach at even par, but few have as many stamps in their afterlife passport as me. It's a gift, I suppose, though not one I'd wish on anyone. 
There will be one more crossing over for me, just as there is for all of us. But most can't tell you what awaits you there, and even I can only report on what I've seen myself, because whether you're meant for the penthouse or the boiler room, it's a place of your own making. Paradise or Hades, heaven or hell -- they're custom made. 
I know because I've been to both.</i></b>
