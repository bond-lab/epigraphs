                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Heaven got sweeter, its paperweight curve
star-crazy at its purple center.
She’d found a god, a weapon in the works.
Something I hadn’t noticed in the field
fought out of the layers and took her.
I tore away the land’s every color,
withered the smallest grasses.  Every heartbeat
went blank, I dismantled the ticking.
 
They only say what I took, not what I gave:
roots and strong light, glory
in the single shoot, green currency
of the just-born.  From the irredeemable,
the buried—this is how a self gets made.
Remember, that darkness contained the seed
sealed in the swollen red globe.
Hell had to pay</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>The Gatekeeper</i> (2009) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.
In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.
Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate;
I am the captain of my soul.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Be to her, Persephone,
 All the things I might not be:
 Take her head upon your knee.
 She that was so proud and wild,
 Flippant, arrogant and free,
 She that had no need of me,
 Is a little lonely child
 Lost in Hell, -- Persephone,
 Take her head upon your knee:
 Say to her, "my dear, my dear,
 It is not so dreadful here."</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>One narcissus among the ordinary beautiful
flowers, one unlike all the others! She pulled,
stooped to pull harder—
when, sprung out of the earth
on his glittering terrible
carriage, he claimed his due.
It is finished. No one heard her.
No one! She had strayed from the herd.(Remember: go straight to school.
This is important, stop fooling around!
Don’t answer to strangers. Stick
with your playmates. Keep your eyes down.)
This is how easily the pit
opens. This is how one foot sinks into the ground.</i></b>
