                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The girl from next door, the borrowed child,
Said to me the other day, "You like children so much,
Don't you want to have some of your own?"
I couldn't believe she could say it.
I thought, "Surely you can look at me and see them."</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I barely got a smile, baby, 
When I hung the moon for you/
