                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When the white men first set foot on our shores, they were hungry; they had no places on which to spread their blankets or kindle their fires. They were feeble; they could do nothing for themselves. Our fathers commiserated their distress, and shared freely with them whatever the Great Spirit had given to his red children.</i></b>
