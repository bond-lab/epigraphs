                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The church fathers, and not only Augustine, condemned as heresy the assertion that Adam, along with Eve, was damned for all eternity. They in fact became saints, their day falling on December 24. They ultimately advanced to patrons -- not as might be expected of the planters of orchards, but rather -- of the guild of tailors. After all, they were the first human beings to wear clothes. And God the Father had sewn their garments Himself.</i></b>
