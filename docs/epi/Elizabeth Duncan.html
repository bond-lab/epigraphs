                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
 Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
 Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
 With this night's revels and expire the term
 Of a despised life closed in my breast
 By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
 But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
 Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,  (1597), Play, UK
