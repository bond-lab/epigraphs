                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"Tell me not, in mournful numbers, 
   Life is but an empty dream! 
For the soul is dead that slumbers, 
   And things are not what they seem. 

Life is real! Life is earnest! 
   And the grave is not its goal; 
Dust thou art, to dust returnest, 
   Was not spoken of the soul. 

Not enjoyment, and not sorrow, 
   Is our destined end or way; 
But to act, that each to-morrow 
   Find us farther than to-day."</i></b>

Took measure of his soul, and knew its strength, 
And by that silent knowledge, day by day, 
Was calm'd, ennobled, comforted, sustain'd. "</i></b>
