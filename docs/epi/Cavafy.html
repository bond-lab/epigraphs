                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The barbarians are to arrive today.
 Why such inaction in the Senate?
 Why do the Senators sit and pass no laws?
 Because the barbarians are to arrive today.
 What further laws can the Senators pass?
 
 ... night is here but the barbarians have not come.
 And some people arrived from the borders,
 and they said that there are no longer any barbarians.
 And now what shall become of us without any barbarians?
 Those people were a kind of solution.</i></b>
