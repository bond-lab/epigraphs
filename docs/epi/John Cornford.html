                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Heart of the heartless world,
Dear heart, the thought of you
Is the pain at my side,
The shadow that chills my view.
The wind rises in the evening, 
Reminds that autumn is near,
I am afraid to lose you,
I am afraid of my fear.
On the last mile of Huesca, 
The last fence for our pride,
Think so kindly, dear, that I
Sense you at my side.
And if bad luck should lay my strength 
Into the shallow grave,
Remember all the good you can;
Don't forget my love.</i></b>
