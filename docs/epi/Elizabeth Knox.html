                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>So when she speaks, the voice of Heaven I hear 
So when we walk, nothing impure comes near; 
Each field seems Eden, and each calm retreat; 
Each village seems the haunt of holy feet. 

But that sweet village where my black-ey'd maid, 
Closes her eyes in sleep beneath night's shade: 
Whene'er I enter, more than mortal fire 
Burns in my soul, and does my song inspire.</i></b>
