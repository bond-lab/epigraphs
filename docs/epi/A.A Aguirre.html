                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Turning and turning in the widening gyre   
The falcon cannot hear the falconer; 
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; 
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, 
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   
The ceremony of innocence is drowned; 
The best lack all conviction, while the worst   
Are full of passionate intensity. 
</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Second Coming</i>,  (1920), Poem, Ireland
