                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Is this a dagger, which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee: --
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
To feeling, as to sight? Or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Macbeth</i>,  (1623), Play, UK
