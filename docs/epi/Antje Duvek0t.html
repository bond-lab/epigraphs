                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>you, you're not the first to ask 
and probably not the last 
and i don't expect you to understand

why i stayed upon this rock 
after the birds had gone 
and all of the waves turned to sand

i am a lighthouse 
in a desert and i stand alone 
i dream of an ocean that was here a long time ago 
and i remember his cool waters and i still glow</i></b>
