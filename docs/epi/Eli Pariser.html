                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In a personalized world, we will increasingly be typed and fed only news that is pleasant, familiar, and confirms our beliefs and because these filters are invisible, we won't know what is being hidden from us. Our past interests will determine what we are exposed to in the future, leaving less room for the unexpected excounters that spark creativity, innovation and the democratic exchange of ideas.</i></b>
