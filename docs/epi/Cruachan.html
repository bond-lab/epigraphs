                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There was an old woman and she lived in the woods
Weile, weile, waile;
There was an old woman and she lived in the woods
Down by the river Saile

She had a baby three months old
Weile, weile, waile
She had a baby three months old
Down by the river Saile;

She had a penknife long and sharp
Weile, weile, waile
She had a penknife long and sharp
Down by the river Saile;

She stuck the penknife in the baby's heart
Weile, weile, waile
She stuck the penknife in the baby's heart
Down by the river Saile;

Three hard knocks came knocking at the door
Weile, weile, waile
Three hard knocks came knocking at the door
Down by the river Saile;

'Are you the woman that killed the child?'
weile weile weile
'Are you the woman that killed the child?'
down by the river Saile?'

The rop was pulled and she got hung,
weile weile weile.
The rope was pulled and she got hung
down by the river Saile.

And that was the end of the woman in the woods,
weile weile weile.
And that was the end of the woman in the woods
down by the river Saile.</i></b>
