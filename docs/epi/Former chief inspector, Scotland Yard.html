                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>All detectives might be called investigators, but not all investigators can be called detectives. Investigators need a trail of facts which might eventually lead to a successful conclusion of their inquiry. If there are no investigative leads to pursue, then they are finished. This is where a detective comes in-a person who can paint a landscape he has never seen from inside a darkened room, which is actually the crime scene. Thatâ€™s the difference between the craft and the art.</i></b>
