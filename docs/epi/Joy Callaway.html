                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The Society attracted all sorts of artists to the grand drawing room on Fifth Avenue. It wasn't the want for fame that drew them there -- though some certainly became known -- or even the anticipation of improvement. Instead, it was the realization that for some, true art, great art, is not won in solitude. It must first be lived.</i></b>
