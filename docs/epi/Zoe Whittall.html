                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Through we live surrounded by evidence of our own importance... deep down we know that we are merely tiny particles in a vast interconnected chang of life, but for the sake of our immediate survival, we don't focus on that fact... In moments of relaxation, passion, joy, and fear or when we are confronted by death, injury or emergencies, this larger context is suddenly reopened for an instant, like a never healed wound.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>After every war
someone has to clean up.
Things won't
straighten themselves up, after all.

Someone has to push the rubble
to the side of the road,
so the corpse-filled wagons
can pass.

Someone has to get mired
in scum and ashes,
sofa springs,
splintered glass,
and bloody rags.

Someone has to drag in a girder
to prop up a wall.
Someone has to glaze a window,
rehang a door.</i></b>
