                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>To express is to drive.
And when you want to give something presence,
you have to consult nature.
And there is where Design comes in.

And fi you think of Brick, for instance,
and you say to Brick,
"What do you want, Brick?"
And Brick says to you,
"I like an Arch."
And if you say to Brick,
"Look, arches are expensive,
and I can use a concrete lintel over you.
What do you think of that,
Brick?"
Brick says:
"... I like an Arch."</i></b>
