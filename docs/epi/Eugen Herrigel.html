                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I cannot think back to those days without recalling, over and over again, how difficult I found it in the beginning to get my breathing to work out right. Though I breathed in technically the right way, whenever I tried to keep my arm and shoulder muscles relaxed while drawing the bow, the muscles of my legs stiffened all the more violently, as though mt life depended on a firm foothold and secure stance, and as though, like Antaeus, I had strength from the ground.</i></b>
