                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>On the night of 25 November 1120 the White Ship set out for England and foundered off Barfleur with all hands save one… The vessel was the latest thing in marine transport, fitted with all the devices known to the shipbuilder of the time… The notoriety of this wreck is due to the very large number of distinguished persons on board; beside the king’s son and heir, there were two royal bastards, several earls and barons, and most of the royal household… its historical significance is that it left Henry without an obvious heir… its ultimate result was the disputed succession and the period of anarchy which followed Henry’s death.</i></b>
