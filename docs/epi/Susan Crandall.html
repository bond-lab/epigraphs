<li>IN: <i>The Flying Circus</i> (2015) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I know that I shall meet my fate
Somewhere among the clouds above;
Those that I fight I do not hate,
Those that I guard I do not love; 
....
A lonely impulse of delight
Drove to this tumult in the clouds;
I balanced all, brought all to mind,
The years to come seemed waste of breath,
A waste of breath the years behind
In balance with this life, this death.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>An Irish Airman Foresees His Death</i>,  (1919), Poem, Ireland
