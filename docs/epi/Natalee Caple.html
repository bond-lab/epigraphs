                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The trail to the great mystic region
Is narrow and dim so they say
While the one that leads to perdition
Is posted and blazed all the way
Whose fault is it then that so many
Go astray on this wild range they fail
Who might have been rich and had plenty
Had they known of that dim narrow trail?</i></b>
