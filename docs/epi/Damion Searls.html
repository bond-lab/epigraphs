                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Why does the painter need a model if he's going to deviate from it? I know the way Matisse laughs with his eyes, and when I put this question to him he laughed thus, silently. He told me, mischievously, that if there were no model one could not deviate from it. This seemed to me at the time a mere wisecrack. Then, as the yeras went by, the thing took its peculiar course within me: I began to love Matisse's very deviation from the model, the way he takes liberties with it. I understand him now, better than I understand myself.</i></b>
