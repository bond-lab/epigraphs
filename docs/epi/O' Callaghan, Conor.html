                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I have given here my own opinions and impressions, and I have no doubt my committee differs from some, but I know no other way of writing. We had all our points of view, though I can only remember one decision that was not unanimous. A member had to be out-voted because he wanted to substitute a harrier for a wolf-hound on the ground that the only occassion known to him when hare and wolf-hound me, the wolf-hound ran away. I am sorry that our meetings have come to an end, for we learned to like each other well.</i></b>
