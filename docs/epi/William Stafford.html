                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Some time when the river is ice ask me 
mistakes I have made. Ask me whether 
what I have done is my life. Others
have come in their slow way into 
my thought, and some have tried to help
or to hurt: ask me what difference 
their strongest love or hate has made.

I will listen to what you say.
You and I can turn and look
at the silent river and wait. We know
the current is there, hidden; and there
are comings and goings from miles away
that hold the stillness exactly before us.
What the river says, that is what I say.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And as elephants parade holding each elephant's tail, 
but if one wanders the circus won't find the park,
I call it cruel and maybe the root of all cruelty
to know what occurs but not recognize the fact.

And so I appeal to a voice, to something shadowy,
a remote important region in all who talk:
though we could fool each other, we should consider --
lest the parade of our mutual life get lost in the dark.</i></b>
