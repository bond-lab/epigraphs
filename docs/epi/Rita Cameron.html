                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, 
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more...

Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster'd importunity.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Hamlet</i>,  (1603), Play, UK
