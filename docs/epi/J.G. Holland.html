                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b> "I know
    That care has iron crowns for many brows;
    That Calvaries are everywhere, whereon
    Virtue is crucified, and nails and spears
    Draw guiltless blood; that sorrow sits and drinks
    At sweetest hearts, till all their life is dry;
    That gentle spirits on the rack of pain
    Grow faint or fierce, and pray and curse by turns;
    That hell's temptations, clad in heavenly guise
    And armed with might, lie evermore in wait
    Along life's path, giving assault to all."</i></b>
