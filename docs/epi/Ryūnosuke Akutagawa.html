                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Among the palm flowers, among the bamboo,
Buddha has already fallen asleep.
By the roadside, a withered fig tree,
Christ, too, seems to be dead.
Yet we need to rest,
Even before the stage set,
(If we look behind that set,
We find only a patched-up canvas)</i></b>
