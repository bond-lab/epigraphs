                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>“How do you know she is a unicorn?” Molly demanded. “And why were you afraid to let her touch you? I saw you. You were afraid of her.” 
“I doubt that I will feel like talking for very long,” the cat replied without rancor. “I would not waste time in foolishness if were you. As to your first question, no cat out of its first fur can ever be deceived by appearances. Unlike human beings, who enjoy them. As for your second question—” Here he faltered, and suddenly became very interested in washing; nor would he speak until he had licked himself fluffy and then licked himsefl smooth again. Even then he would not look at Molly, but examined his claws.
“If she had touched me," he said very softly, "I would have been hers and not my own, not ever again."</i></b>
