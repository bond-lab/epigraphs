                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>He laughed and smote with the laughter and thrust up over his head, 
And smote the venom asunder, and clave the heart of Dread; 
Then he leapt from the pit and the grave, and the rushing river of blood,
And fulfilled with the joy of the War-God on the face of earth be stood
With red sword high uplifted, with wrathful glittering eyes; 
And he laughed at the heavens above him for he saw the sun arise, 
And Sigurd gleamed on the desert, and shone in the new-born light, 
And the wind in his raincoat wavered, and all the world was bright. 
But there was the ancient Fafnir, and the Face of Terror lay 
On the huddled folds of the Serpent, that were black and ashen-grey
In the desert lit by the sun; and those twain looked each on each,
And forth from the Face of Terror went a sound of dreadful speech:
"Child, child, who art thou that hast smitten? bright child, of whence is thy birth?" 
"I am called the Wild-thing Glorious, and alone I wend on the earth."</i></b>

Drawn from the purple hills afar,
Drawn down unto the restless sea.

Still beaten by the billows green,
Whose murmur comes unceasingly
Unto the place for which I cry.</i></b>

Belonging to the time ere I was brought

Glorifying all things; for a little word,
Scarce ever meant at all, must I now prove

Stone-cold for ever?</i></b>
