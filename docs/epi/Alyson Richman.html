                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>O Notre-Dame, Notre Dame,
rock-like, mountain-like, eagle-like, crouching-lion-like cathedral
reef sunk in vast air,
square pillar of Paris,
sealed by the blinding splatters of rain,
taking the slapping wind head-on.
O soaring in front, Notre-Dame of Paris,
it's me, looking up at you.
It's that Japanese.
My heart trembles now that I see you.
Looking at your form like a tragedy,
a young man from a distant country is moved.
Not knowing for what reason, my heart pounds
in union with the screams in the air, resounds as if terrified.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Cathedral in the Thrashing Rain</i>,  (None), Poem, Japan
