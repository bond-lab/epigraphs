                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We are the last of our kind. 

We will not fade into the dark. We will tell our story to the stars and in this way we will never die - we will be Undying. Perhaps only the stars will hear us until we are nothing more than a memory. But someday a race will find the power we left behind - and they will be tested, for some things are better left unknown. Some stories left untold. Some words left unsaid.

Some powers left alone.

Ours is a story of greed and destruction, of a people not ready for the treasure they guarded. Our end came not from the stars but from within, from war and chaos. We were not, and never had been, worthy of what had been given to us. 

Within the mathematical cipher of this message lies a key to build a door into the aether. Beyond the door, beyond the aether, you will face your trial. The worthy, the chosen, will find the power we died to protect, and rise into the stars. 

Know that the journey is unending. Know that the dangers ahead will be many. Know that unlocking the door may lead to salvation or doom. So choose. Choose the stars or the void; choose hope or despair; choose light or the undying dark of space. 

Choose - and travel onward, if you dare. </i></b>
