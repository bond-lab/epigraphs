                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The future is a door.
Two forces -- forces that we drive like horses and chariouts, whips to their backs, wheels in ruts, great froth and furious vigor -- race to that door.
The first force is evolution. Humanity changing, growing, becoming better than it was.
The second force is ruination. Humanity making its best effort to demonstrate its worst tendencies. A march toward self-destruction. 
Will humanity evolve and become something better? 
Or will we cut our own throats with the knives we made?</i></b>
