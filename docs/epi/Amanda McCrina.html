<li>IN: <i>His Own Good Sword</i> (2012) Fiction, Young Adult Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When the oppress'd for justice looks in vain, 
When his sore burden may no more be borne, 
With fearless heart he makes appeal to Heaven, 
And thence brings down his everlasting rights, 
Where there abide, inalienably his, 
And indestructible as are the stars. 
Nature's primeval state returns again, 
Where man stands hostile to his fellw man; 
And if all other means shall fail his need, 
One last resource remains - his own good sword.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Friedrich, Schiller, Tell, William</i>,  (1804), Folk, Switzerland
