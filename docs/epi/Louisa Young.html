                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>“Joy, warm as the joy that shipwrecked sailors feel when they catch sight of the land . . . only a few escape, swimming and struggling out of the frothing surf to reach the shore, their bodies crusted with salt but buoyed up with joy as they plant their feet on solid ground again, spared a deadly fate. So joyous now to her the sight of her husband, vivid in her gaze, that her white arms, embracing his neck, would never for a moment let him go . . .”</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I knew that I was more than the something which had been looking out all that day upon the visible earth adn thinking and speaking and tasting friendship. Somewhere -- close at hand in that rosy thicket or far off beyond the ribs of sunset -- I was gathered up with an immortal company, where I and poet and lover and flower and cloud and star were equals, as all the little leaves were equal ruffling before the gusts, or sleeping and carved out of the silentness. And in that company I learned that I am something which no fortune can touch, whether I be soon to die or long years away. Things will happen which will trample and pierce, but I shall go on, something that is here and there like the wind, something unconquerable, something not to be separated from the dark earth and the light sky, a strong citizen of infinity and eternity. The confidence and ease had become a deep joy; I knew that I could not do without the Infinite; nor the Infinite without me.</i></b>
