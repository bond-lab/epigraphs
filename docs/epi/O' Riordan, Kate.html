                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>At half-past three a single bird	
Unto a silent sky	
Propounded but a single term	
Of cautious melody.	
  
At half-past four, experiment	        
Had subjugated test,	
And lo! her silver principle	
Supplanted all the rest.	
  
At half-past seven, element	
Nor implement was seen,	        
And place was where the presence was,	
Circumference between.</i></b>
