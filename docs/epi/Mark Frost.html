                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I live my life in growing orbits
Which move out over the things of the world. 
Perhaps I can never achieve the last, 
But that will be my attempt. 
I am circling around God, around the ancient tower, 
And I have been circling for a thousand years, 
And I still don't know if I'm a falcon, or a storm, 
Or a great song.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>I Live my Life in Growing Orbit</i>,  (1905), Poem, Czech Republic
