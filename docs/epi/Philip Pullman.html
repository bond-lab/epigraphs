                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Into this wild abyss, 
The womb of nature and perhaps her grave, 
Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, 
But all these in their pregnant causes mixed 
Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight, 
Unless the almighty maker them ordain 
His dark materials to create more worlds, 
Into this wild abyss the wary fiend 
Stood on the brink of hell
and looked a while, 
Pondering his voyage...</i></b>

Whose robe is the light, whose canopy sprace; 
His chariots of wrath the deep thunder clouds form,

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Fine vapors escape from whatever is doing the living.
The night is cold and delicate and full of angels

The chime goes unheard.
We are together at last, though far apart.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The morning comes, the night decays, the watchmen leave their stations;
The grave is burst, the spices shed, the linen wrapped up;
The bones of death, the cov'ring clay the sinews shrunk & dry’d
Reviving shake, inspiring move, breathing, awakening,
Spring like redeemed captives when their bonds & bars are burst.
Let the slave grinding at the mill run out into the field,
Let him look up into the heavens & laugh in the bright air; 
Let the inchained soul, shut up in darkness and in sighing,
Whose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary years,
Rise and look out; his chains are loose, his dungeon doors are open;
And let his wife and children return from the oppressor’s scourge.
They look behind at every step & believe it is a dream,
Singing: “The Sun has let his blackness & has found a fresher morning,
And the fair Moon rejoices in the clear & cloudless night;
For Empire is no more, and now the Lion & Wolf shall cease.” </i></b>
