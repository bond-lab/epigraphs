                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and piquancy and phantasm. . . . There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And we, all our lives, like Jules, are incurably romantic. We shall go, therefore, to our first ball at the Opera because it, too, will endeavour to revive the romantic age. ... And it will be the same. In the crystal cups on the buffet tables, the same golden sunlight of the champagne swims and sparkles. Beneath the black mask and below the broad concealing hat still shine the bright eyes of danger.</i></b>
