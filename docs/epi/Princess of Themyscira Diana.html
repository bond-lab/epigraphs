                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I used to want to save the world. This beautiful place. But I knew so little then. It is a land of beauty and wonder, worth cherishing in every way. But the closer you get, the more you see the great darkness simmering within. And mankind? 
Mankind is another story altogether.
What one does when faced with the truth is more difficult than you think. 
I learned this the hard way a long, long time ago. And now, I will never be the same.</i></b>
