                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Shaw's father wanted no monument
except the ditch
where his son's body was thrown
and lost with his "niggers"

The ditch is nearer, 
There are no statues for the last war here;
on Boylston Street, a commercial photograph 
shows Hiroshima boiling

Over a Mosler Safe, the "Rock of Ages"
that survived the blast, Space is nearer. When I crouch to my television set, 
the drained faces of negro school-children rise like balloons</i></b>

where the venerable elm sickens, and hardens
with tarred cement, where no leaf
is born, or falls, or resists till winter.

But I remember its former fertility,
how everything came out clearly 
in the hour of credulity
and young summer, when this street 
was already somewhat overshaded,
and here at the altar of surrender, 
i met you,
the death of thirst in my brief flesh.</i></b>
