                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Christ have mercy on all sleeping things!
From that dog rotting down Wrightson Road
to when I was a dog on these streets;
if loving these islands must be my load,
out of corruption my soul takes wings,
But they had started to poison my soul
with their big house, big car, big-time bohbohl,
coolie, nigger, Surian, and French Creole,
so I leave if for them and their carnival -- 
I taking a sea-bath, I gone down the road.
I know these islands from Monos to Nassau,
a rusty head sailor with sea-green eyes
that they nickname Shabine, the patois for
any red nigger, and I, Shabine, saw
when these slums of empire was paradise.
I'm just a red nigger who love the sea,
I had a sound colonial education,
I have Dutch, nigger, and English in me,
and either I'm nobody, or I'm a nation.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The time will come 
when, with elation, 
you will greet yourself arriving 
at your own door, in your own mirror, 
and each will smile at the other’s welcome,
and say, sit here. Eat. 
You will love again the stranger who was your self. 
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart 
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you

all your life, whom you ignored 
for another, who knows you by heart. 
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,

the photographs, the desperate notes 
peel your own image from the mirror. 
Sit. Feast on your life. </i></b>

Serpentlike, its roots obscene

Outlandish phalloi
Haunting the travellers of its one road.</i></b>
