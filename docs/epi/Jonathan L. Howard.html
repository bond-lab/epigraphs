                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I am Leviathan, 
I come to you in blood
And lie in shadows. 
My heart is a sun, 
And my nerves sing with lightning.
I have come to kill you. 
All of you. Each and every one. 
Every man, 
And every woman,
And every child. 
As you huddle in families,
Or hide alone.
I shall not let any of you live. 
For I am Leviathan.
I come to you in blood
And sleep in shadows. 
My heart is a sun,
And my mind...
My mind...</i></b>
