                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I have lived in the desert for years and I have come to believe in such things. It is a place of pockets. The trompe l'oeil of time and water. The jackal with one eye that looks back and one that regards the path you consider taking. In his jaws are pieces of the past he delivers to you, and when all of that time is fully discovered it will prove to have been already known.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The English Patient</i>,  (1992), Novel, Sri Lanka/Canada
