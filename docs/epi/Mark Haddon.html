                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Now, bring it down
in the kind of fire that flows along ceilings, 
that knows the spectral blues; that always starts in donut fryers or boardwalk kindling
in the dead hour before dawn, that leaves pilings
marooned by mindless tides, that sends a plume
of black smoke high enough to stain the halls
of clouds. Now look around your tiny room
And tell me that you haven't got the power.</i></b>
