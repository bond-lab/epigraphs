                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Recent reports both through the newspapers and through secret service, have given indications that the Germans may be in possession of a powerful new weapon which is expected to be ready between November and January [1944]. There seems to be considerable probability that this new weapon is tube alloy [i.e., uranium]. It is not necessary to describe the probable consequence which would result if this proves to be the case. 
It is possible that the Germans will have, by the end of this year, enough material accumulated to make a large number of gadgets which they will release at the same time on England, Russia and this country. In this case, there would be little hope for counter-action... This would place particularly Britain in an extremely serious position but there would be hope for counter-action from our side before the war is lost, provided our own tube-alloy program is drastically accelerated in the next few weeks.</i></b>
