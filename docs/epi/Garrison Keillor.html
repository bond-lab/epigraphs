                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Dogs don't lie, and why should I? 
Strangers come, they growl and bark. 
They know their loved ones in the dark.
Now let me, by night or day, 
Be just as full of truth as they.</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>Love Me</i> (2001) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>As you travel day by day 
Along your earthly way 
Of the faces that you see 
Love Me.
On the dark and stormy plain, 
In the wind and sleet and rain, 
Not a friendly house or tree, 
Just Me. 
I know you could do better 
If you shopped around.
I'm just an old dead letter 
Waiting in the lost and found. 
I'm not smart or debonair, 
Not the answer to a prayer,
But here's my simple plea:
O darling 
My darling, 
Love Me.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>My parents think I'm crazy, 
My kids think I'm bourgeois-- 
My true love thinks I'm wonderful, 
The handsomest she ever saw, 
And who am I to disagree 
With one so sensible as she?</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>O my Lord God almighty and everlasting, grant me a prayerful heart. Even in the tumult of prosperity and all ordinary distress, give me words to address to Thee, O great Attender to misfortune, and when my spirit is defeated and my faith is an ash pit, yet grant me a silent prayer, O Merciful, O Giver of Life and Creator of this day, this piece of wood.</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>WLT: A Radio Romance</i> (1989) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I learned this at least by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavours to live that life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him. If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.</i></b>
