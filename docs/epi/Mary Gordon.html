<li>IN: <i>The Company of Women</i> (1980) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>What draws
singular lives together in the first place,
loneliness, lust, ambition, 

or mere convenience, is obvious, why they drop
or murder one another
clear enough: how they create, though, a common 
world
between them, like Bombelli's

impossible yet useful numbers, no one
has yet explained. Still, they do
managed to forgive impossible behavior,
to endure by some mircale

conversational tics and larval habits
without wincing...

The ogre will come in any case:
so Joyce has warned us. Howbeit,
fasting or feasting, we both know this: without
the Spirit we die, but life

without the Letter is in the worst of taste,
and always, though truth and love
can never really differ, when they seem to, 
the subaltern should be truth.</i></b>
