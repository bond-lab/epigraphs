                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I sang to my dear dead mother
and she instantly understood me, 
and pressing a kiss to my forehead said
as into her arms she pulled me:
"Believe then in truth, or in fantasy -- 
if you'll only believe in it utterly!
For truth is what you believe it to be.
My son, believe in your dreams!'</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Smiling Apollo</i>,  (1898), Poem, Finland
