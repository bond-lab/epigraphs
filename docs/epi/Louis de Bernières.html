                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"Down some cold field in a world outspoken / the young men are walking together, slim and tall, / and though they laugh to one another, silence is not broken; / there is no sound however clear they call. / They are speaking together of what they loved in vain here, / but the air is too thin to carry the things they say. / They were young and golden, but they came on pain here, / and their youth is age now, their gold is grey. / Yet their hearts are not changed, and they cry to one another, / 'What have they done with the lives we laid aside? / Are they young with our youth, gold with our gold, my brother? / Do they smile in the face of death, because we died?' / Down some cold field in a world uncharted / the young seek each other with questioning eyes. / They question each other, the young, the golden hearted, / of the world that they were robbed of in their quiet paradise."</i></b>
