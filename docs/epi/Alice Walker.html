                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I come out of a tradition where those things are valued; where you talk about a woman with big legs and big hips and black skin. I come out of a black community where it was all right to have hips and to be heavy. You didn't feel that people didn't like you. The values that [imply] you must be skinny come from another culture... Those are not the values that I was given by the women who served as my models. I refuse to be judged by the values of another culture. I am a black woman, and I will stand as best I can in that imagery. </i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I had always got on well with the Africans and enjoyed their company, but commanding the people on the farm, many of whom had watched us grow up, was different. With the added experience of my safaris behind me, I had begun to understand the code of "birth, copulation and death" by which they lived. Black people are natural, they possess the secret of joy, which is why they can survive the suffering and humiliation inflicted upon them. They are alive physically and emotionally, which makes them easy to live with. What I had not yet learned to deal with was their cunning and natural instinct for self-preservation. </i></b>

That's so marvellous! I think angels are envious of human because we have bodies; they don't, and love-making makes the angels flap their wings in envy... Human sexuality is a mystical moment in the history of the Universe. All the angels and all the other beings come out to wonder at this.</i></b>
