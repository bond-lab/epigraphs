another tree
inhabits the same body;
within this stone
another stone rests,
its many shades of grey
the same,
its identical
surface and weight.
And within my body,
another body,
whose history, waiting,
sings: there is no other body,
it sings,
there is no other world.</i></b>

Not the simple resistance of a pillow, whose foam
returns over and over to the same shape, but the
sinuous
tenacity of a tree: finding the light newly blocked
on one side,
it turns in another. A blind intelligence, true.
But out of such persistence arose turtles, rivers,
mitochondria, figs - all this resinous, unretractable
earth.</i></b>
