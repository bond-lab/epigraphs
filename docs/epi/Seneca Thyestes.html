                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>...I live in mighty fear that all the universe will be broken into a thousand fragments in the general ruin, that formless chaos will return ad vanquish the gods and men, that the earth and sea will be engulfed by the planets wandering the heavens.
... Of all the generations, it is we who have been chosen to merit this bitter fate, to be crushed by the falling pieces of broken sky.</i></b>
