                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We should rise up and praise when we talk about what friendship is and love is and what lovers are about -- this interpenetration of one another's souls by way of the body. That's so marvellous! I think angels are envious of human because we have bodies; they don't, and love-making makes the angels flap their wings in envy... Human sexuality is a mystical moment in the history of the Universe. All the angels and all the other beings come out to wonder at this.</i></b>
