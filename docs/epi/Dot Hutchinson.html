                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Away, come away. 
Empty your heart of its mortal dream. 
The winds awaken, the leaves whirl round. 
Our cheeks are pale, our hair is unbound, 
Our breasts are heaving, our eyes are a-gleam, 
Our arms are waving, our lips are apart; 
And if any gaze on our rushing band, 
We come between him and the deed of his hand, 
We come between him and the hope of his heart.</i></b>

So shall you hear of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, of deaths put on by cunning and for no cause, and, in this upshot, purposes mistook fallen on th' inventors' heads.</i></b>
