                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were; I have not seen
As others saw; I could not bring
My passions from a common spring. 
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone; 
And all I loved, I loved alone.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Alone</i>,  (1829), Poem, US
