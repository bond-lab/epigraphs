                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Here they come, returning from the road,
Thirsty ghosts, skirts desert swept,
Their mirage breath smeared, burnt,
Bad-i-sad-o-bist-roz dry and dust-blasted,
Here they come, returning from the road.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Because the keys to the Kingdom got locked inside the Kingdom 
And the angels fly around in there but we can't see them
I got a girl in the war, Paul, I know that they can hear me yell
If they can't find a way to help her they can go to Hell.</i></b>
