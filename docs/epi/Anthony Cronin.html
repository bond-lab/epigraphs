                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Women in the money-making world, 
Climbing to the top,
Women in pin-striped suits,
Clutching briefcases, hurrying,
Going up in lifts
With set jaws and anxious faces...

Surely when they entered
This daily madness,
We might have hoped that they would somehow
Do more to transmute
Its vast encompassing sadness.</i></b>
