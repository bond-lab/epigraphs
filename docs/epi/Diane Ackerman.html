                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The initial mystery that attends any journey is: how did the traveller reach his starting point in the first place? How did I reach the window, the walls, the fireplace, the room itself; how do I happen to be beneath this ceiling and above this floor? Oh that is a matter for conjecture, for argument pro and con, for research, supposition, dialectic! I can hardly remember now. Unlike Living-stone, on the verge of darkest Africa, I have no maps to hand, no globe of the terrestial or the celestial sphere, no chart of moutains, lakes, no sextant, no artificial horizon. If ever I possessed a compass, it has long since disappeared. There must be, however, some reasonable explanation for my presence here. Some step started me toward this point, as opposed to all other points on the habitable globe. I must consider; I must discover it.</i></b>
