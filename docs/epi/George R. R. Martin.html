                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Mississippi Roll is a saven-card stud poker game. 
The rules are as follows:
1. Seven cards are dealt to each player, facedown.
2. Each player passes one card to the player on his left.
3. Each player passes two cards to the player on his left.
4. Each player passes three cards to the player on his left.
5. Each player discards two cards from his hand, arranges the five remaining cards in the order he wishes to reveal them, and places his hand facedown in a pack before him on the table.
6. The players roll their top card. A round of betting follows, starting with the player with the high card showing.
7. The remaining cards are revealed one by one, with each roll followed by a round of betting.
8. The high hand and low hand split the pot.</i></b>

Everyone was getting laid
Dope was of the highest grade
Those were the days

Always knew who you could trust
Cruising in your micro-bus
They were them and we were us
Those were the days

All the things we're into then
Tarot cards, I Ching, and Zen
Mister, we could use a man like 
Timothy Leary again!

Hardly needed any cash
Everybody shared their stash
Always had a place to crash
Those were the days!</i></b>
