                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Our whole happiness and power of energetic action depend upon our being able to breathe and live in the cloud; content to see it opening here and closing there; rejoicing to catch, through the thinnest films of it, glimpses of stable and substantial things; but yet perceiving a nobleness even in the concealment, and rejoicing that the kindly veil is spread where the untempered light might have scorched us, or the infinite clearness wearied.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Modern Painters, Vol IV</i>,  (1860), Book, UK
