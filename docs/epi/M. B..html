                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Maid of a stranger land whose sunburnt brow
Is kissed at will by every wandering breeze;
Whose eye, of hue like night, hath spells
More potent far than ever Egypt owned;
Oh! why wert thou to perilous beauty born!
Oh! why to bear a fate more sad,
More strange, more dark, than e'er thy lip
Has prophesied to others!</i></b>
