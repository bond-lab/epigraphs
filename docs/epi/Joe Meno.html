<li>IN: <i>Marvel and a Wonder</i> (2015) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Hamlet</i>,  (1603), Play, UK
