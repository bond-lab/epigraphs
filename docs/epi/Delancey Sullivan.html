                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Entropy's a bitch. 
Fate is cruel, luck is fickle, love is strange. Entropy is all those and more. Pitiless and brutal and jagged as the rocks that break the tide. 
You can clutch to your chest all the things you love most, and entropy will scatter them with a breath. It will leave you cold and alone in the middle of chaos, they eye of your own personal hurricane.
I was born to fight entropy. 
I lost. 
I am not done fighting.</i></b>
