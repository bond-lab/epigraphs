                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Lucie, age four

 I am scrunched up as small as small can be in my special place. My knees are right under my chin so that when I put out my tongue I can lick the scab on my right knee from where I fell off the swing in the playground. Scabs help you get better. You mustn't pick them. My heart is boom-booming in my chest and I have that sick feeling like when I needed to go toilet at school but didn't want to say and ended up in a warm puddle with my face hot and everyone laughing. It's not comfy sitting like this in my special place. My legs are hurting. Now I'm a big girl, nearly at big school, I don't really fit in my special place anymore, but I dare not move. I must stay as still as a statue. It's dark in my special place and I'm frightened but I mustn't make a sound. I must be as quiet as a little mouse. Eek, eek, eek.
  Or Mummy will find me.</i></b>
