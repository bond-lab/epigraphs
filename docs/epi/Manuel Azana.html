                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the events in Spain I see an insult, a revolt against intelligence, non-rationality and uncivil primitivism unleashed to such an extent that the foundations of my own rationality are shaken. In this conflict, my judgment should lead me to rejection, to turning my back on everything reason condemns. I cannot. My affliction as a Spaniard dominates everything. This voluntary servitude will be with me forever, and I can never be an exile. I feel all things Spanish as my own, and even the most odious must be endured, like a painful malady. But that does not prevent me from understanding the disease that we are dying of, or more precisely, the disease we have already died of; because everything we might say now about the past sounds like something from another world.</i></b>
