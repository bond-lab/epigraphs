                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There is a remarkably close parallel between the problems of the physicist and those of the cryptographer. The system on which a message is enciphered corresponds to the laws of the universe, the intercepted messages to the evidence available, the keys for a day or a message to the evidence available, the keys for a day or a message to important constants which have to be determined. The correspondence is very close, but the subject matter of cryptography is very easily dealt with by discrete machinery, physics not so easily.</i></b>

 "It so coincided that Marcos had money", she said. "After the Bretton Woods agreement he started buying gold fro Fort Knox. Three thousand tons, then 4,000 tons. I have documents for these: 7,000 tons. Marcos was so smart. He had it all. It's funny. America didn't understand him.</i></b>

Backwards and forwards swings the great pendulum, and its alternations are not determined by a few distinguished folk clinging to the end of it.</i></b>
