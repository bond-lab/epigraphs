                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I had an assignment the other day. Someone asked me to write a letter for a time capsule that was going to be opened in Los Angeles a hundred years from now… It sounded like an easy assignment. They suggested I write something about the problems and issues of the day, and I set out to do so, riding down the coast in an automobile, looking at the blue Pacific out on one side and the Santa Ynez Mountains on the other, and I couldn’t help but wonder if it was going to be that beautiful a hundred years from now as it was on that summer day. And then, as I tried to write… let your minds turn to that task. You’re going to write for people a hundred years from now who know all about us. We know nothing about them. We don’t know what kind of world they’ll be living in.</i></b>
