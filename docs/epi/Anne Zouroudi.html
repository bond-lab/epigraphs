<li>IN: <i>The Lady of Sorrows</i> (2010) Fiction, British
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"She harbours in her heart a furious hate,
And thou shalt find the dire effects too late; 
Fix'd on revenge, and obstinate to die.
Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly.
The sea with ships will soon be cover'd o'er,
And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore. 
Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies,
And sail before the purple morn arise.
Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring?
Woman's a various and a changeful thing."
Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight
Aloft in air unseen, and mix'd with night.</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>The Taint of Midas</i> (2008) Fiction, British
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The rich poor fool, confounded with surprise,
Starving in all his various plenty lies:
Sick of his wish, he now detests the pow'r,
For which he ask'd so earnestly before;
Amidst his gold with pinching famine curst;
And justly tortur'd with an equal thirst.
At last his shining arms to Heav'n he rears,
And in distress, for refuge, flies to pray'rs.
O father Bacchus, I have sinn'd, he cry'd,
And foolishly thy gracious gift apply'd;
Thy pity now, repenting, I implore;
Oh! may I feel the golden plague no more.
The hungry wretch, his folly thus confest,
Touch'd the kind deity's good-natur'd breast;
The gentle God annull'd his first decree,
And from the cruel compact set him free.</i></b>

<li>IN: <i>The Bull of Mithros</i> (2012) Fiction, British
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Thou seest how sloth wastes the sluggish body, as water is corrupted unless it moves.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Epistulae ex Ponto Book I</i>,  (9), Poem, Italy
<li>IN: <i>The Doctor of Hessaly</i> (2009) Fiction, British
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>...There within
she saw that Envy was intent upon
a meal of viper flesh, the meat that fed
her vice... And when she saw the splendid goddess dressed
in gleaming armour, Envy moaned: her face
contracted as she sighed. That face is wan,
that body shriveled; and her gaze is not
direct; her teeth are filled with filth and rot;
her breast is green with gall, and poison coasts
her tongue. She never smiles except when some
sad sight brings her delight; she is denied
sweet sleep, for she is too preoccupied,
forever vigilant; when men succeed,
she is displeased -- success means her defeat.
She gnaws at others and at her own self --
her never-ending, self-inflicted hell...</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>His end was recorded somewhere and then lost;
Or perhaps History passed it by, 
And with good reason, a thing as trivial
as that she didn't deign to record.</i></b>

Mistake themselves for carpet-bags
And tumble victuals in.'</i></b>
