                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When a baby is taken from the wet nurse,
it easily forgets her
and starts eating solid food.
Seeds feed a while on ground,
then lift up into the sun. 
So you should taste the filtered light
and work your way toward wisdom
with no personal covering.
That's how you came here, like a star
without a name. Move across the night sky
with those anonymous lights.</i></b>
