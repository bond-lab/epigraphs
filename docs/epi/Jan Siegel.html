                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Here's the house without a door
Here's the room without a floor
Here's the cat that chased the rat
Here's the rat that bit the cat
Here's the dog that didn't bark
Here's the flame without a spark
Here's a candle to light the proud
Here's a spindle to spin your shroud
Here's a farewell where'er you roam
Here's a death knell to ring you home
Heres a church and there's the steeple
Open the doors and here are the people.</i></b>
