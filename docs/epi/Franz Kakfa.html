                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>His gaze fell upin the top story of the building adjoining the quarry. Like a light flicking on, the casements of a window flew open, a human figure, faint and insubstantial at that distance and height, leaned far out abruptly, and stretched both arms out even further. Who was it? A friend? A good person? Someone who cared? Someone who wanted to help? Was it just one person? Was it everyone? (...) He raised his hands and spread all his fingers.</i></b>

Remain sitting at your table and listen.

To be unmasked, it has no choice.
It will roll in ecstasy at your feet.</i></b>
