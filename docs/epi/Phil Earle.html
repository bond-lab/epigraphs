                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>We could see them through the trellis, 
From the pit where we sat, 
Framed, 
Two boys swapping stickers. 
The two of us 
Talking of battlefields and bedrooms, 
And swapping stickers. 
And how the faces are now changed,
The frames frayed 
But become something mirror-familiar â€“ 
Each other's heroes, perhaps. 
And, even across enemy lines, 
Brothers, being there. 
And how paths part, criss-cross 
Through sanded pits and poppy fields, 
Then meet again, 
At a point somewhere solid, 
Framed, like a medal. 
At its heart two boys 
Swapping stickers.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Haven't had a dream in a long time 
See, the life I've had
Can make a good man bad

So for once in my life 
Let me get what I want 
Lord knows, it would be the first time
Lord knows, it would be the first time</i></b>
