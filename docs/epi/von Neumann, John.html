                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"Intervention in atmospheric and climatic matters will... unfold on a scale difficult to imagine at present. Such action would be more directly and truly worldwide than recent, or presumably future, wars or the economy at any time. All this will merge each nation's affairs with those of every other, more thoroughly than the threat of a nuclear or any other war would have done."</i></b>
