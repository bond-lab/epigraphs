                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Odd that living in anger should be so pleasant! It involves a kind of heroism. If the object against which one railed yesterday should die, one would immediately set about looking for another. "What shall I complain about today? Whom shall I despise? Could that person be the monster?... Oh joy! I've found him. Come, friends, let's tear him to pieces.!"</i></b>
