                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The less natural and urgent needs are, the stronger the passions and what is worse, the greater the power to satisfy them; so that after long prosperity, after having swallowed up many treasures and ruined many men, my hero will end up by killing everything until he is sole master of the universe. Such is in brief the moral picture, if not of human life, at least of the secret aspirations in the heart of every civilized man.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Towards what is called civil, love made me pursue an adventure that led to prison. If they are not always beeautiful, men bound to evil possess the manly virtues. By their own choice or a choice made for them by accident, they steep themselvs knowingly, uncomplainingly into a reproachful shameful element lke the one entered by victims of profound love. Erotic games uncover an ieffable world. The nocturnal language of lovers reveal it but such a language is not written down.</i></b>
