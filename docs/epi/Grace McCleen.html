                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>"Sometimes," Pere de Grandmaison tells us, "during the contemplation of a work of art, or while listening to a melody, the effort to understand relaxes, and the soul simply delights itself in the beauty which it divines... or merely a memory, a word, a line of Dante or Racine shooting up from the obscure depths of our soul, seizes hold of us, 'recollects' and penetrates us. After this experience we know no more than we did, but we have this impression of understanding a little something that before we hardly knew, of tasting a fruit the rind of which we have scarely nibbled." Such an experience is, among others, an instance of those "profane states of nature in which we can decipher the great lines, and discern the image and rough sketch of the mystical states of the soul..."</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It has been deduced from the belief in Pure Sound that the resultant meaning of the words need not be known, that it is enough to know the meaning of the words in isolation and enough of their syntax to read them aloud rightly. In a degree this is often true, but it is best to regard this state of limited knowledge as a complicated state of indecision which involves much estimating of probabilites, and is less ignorance than an ordered suspension of judgement... a musical chord is a direct sensation, but not therefore unanalyzable into its separate notes even at the moment of sensing. It can be either felt or thought; the two things are similar but different; and it requires practice to do both at once.</i></b>

Yes, I lifted my hand in an oath and I said: "I am the Lord, your God." In that day I swore to them I would bring them forth from the land of captivity to a land that I was out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey; it was the decoration of all the lands.</i></b>
