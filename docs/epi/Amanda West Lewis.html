                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I begin with the young. We older ones are messed up. We are rotten to the marrow. But my magnificent youngsters! Are there any finer ones in the world? Look at these young men and boys! What material. With them I can make a new world. My teaching will be hard. Weakness will be knocked out of them. A violently active, dominating, brutal youth - that is what I am after. Youth must be indifferent to pain. There must be no weakness and tenderness in it. I want to see onec more in its eyes the gleam of pride and independence of the beast of prey.</i></b>
