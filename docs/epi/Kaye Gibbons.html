With troubled fingers to the silece which
Smothers you, A mummy, in time</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Shaw's father wanted no monument
except the ditch
where his son's body was thrown
and lost with his "niggers"

The ditch is nearer, 
There are no statues for the last war here;
on Boylston Street, a commercial photograph 
shows Hiroshima boiling

Over a Mosler Safe, the "Rock of Ages"
that survived the blast, Space is nearer. When I crouch to my television set, 
the drained faces of negro school-children rise like balloons</i></b>
