                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Our English practice of excluding from literature subjects and refer- ences that are unfit for boys and girls, has something to recommend it, but
it undeniably leans to a certain narrowness and thinness, and to some
most nauseous hypocrisy. All subjects are not to be discussed by all ; and
one result in our case is that some of the most Important subjects In the world receive no discussion whatever.</i></b>
