<li>IN: <i>Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm</i> (1903) Children, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair; 
Like Twilightâ€™s, too, her dusky hair;
But all things else about her drawn 
From May-time and the cheerful Dawn;
A dancing Shape, an Image gay,
To haunt, to startle, and way-lay.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>She Was a Phantom of Delight</i>,  (1807), Poem, UK
