                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>- take the thought of this calm vesper time,
With its low murmuring sounds of silvery light,
On through the dark days fading from their prime,
As a sweet dew to keep your souls from blight!
Earth will forsake. O! happy to have given
The unbroken heart's first fragrance unto Heaven.</i></b>
