                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Eastward roll the orbs of heaven, 
Westward tend the thoughts of men:
Let the Poet, nature-driven, 
Wander Eastward now and then.

There the calm of life comparing 
With his Europe's busy fate, 
Let him, gladly homeward faring, 
Learn to labour and to wait.</i></b>
