And then, before you know it, the images are repeated in slow motion with the Samuel Barber soundtrck and a close-up photograph of a sinegd teddy bear. Then you cry because somebody is making you and you wind up feeling confused and manipulated, like your own feelings weren't quite good enough and you needed professional help.</i></b>
