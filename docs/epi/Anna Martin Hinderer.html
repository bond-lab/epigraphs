The long dark shadows of past grief and fear;
Look not beyond, thou canst not see the shore
Now through the gloom, yet may the port be near.
Let vain regrets and sea forebodings cease,
He will give strength and peace.</i></b>

For the love of Christ our Lord?

Should it cost no less than life,
Christ is our reward.

O blessed course so well and nobly run!
O home of true and everlasting gladness!
O crown unfading! and so early won!

Though tears will fall, we bless Thee, O our Father,
For the dear one for ever with the blest!
And wait the Easter dawn when Thou shalt gather
Thine own, long parted, to their endless rest.</i></b>
