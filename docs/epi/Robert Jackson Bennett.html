"Life is death and death is life.
To shed blood is to behold this holiest of transitions, the interwoven mesh of the world,
The flow from shrieking life to rot and ash.
For those who wage Her wars, who become Her swords, 
She will deem you shriven and holiest of holies.
And you shall forever reside beside Herin the City of Blades."
And he sang
"Come across the waters, Children, 
To whitest shores and quiet pilgrims,
Long dark awaits
In Voortya's shadow."</i></b>

And they said to Her: 'You blessed us as Your people, and we rejoiced, and were happy. But we found those who were not Your people, and they would not become Your people, and they were wilful and ignorant of You. They would not open their ears to Your songs, or lay Your words upon their tongues. They would not listen. So we dashed them upon the rocks and threw down their houses and shed their blood and scattered them to the winds, and we were right to do so. For we are Your people. We carry Your blessings. We are Yours, and so we are right. Is this not what You said?'
And Olvos was silent.</i></b>
