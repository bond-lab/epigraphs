                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Physical force may prevail for a time... but there is music in the sound of moral force which will be heard like the sound of the cuckoo. The bird lays its eggs, and leaves them for a time; but it will come again and hatch them in due course, and the song will return with the season.</i></b>
