                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>If you ask me, Mary,' continued Flora, 'I think I have much in common with Miss Austen. She liked everything to be tidy and pleasant and comfortable about her and so do I. You see, Mary,' - and here Flora began to grow earnest and wave one finger about - 'unless everything is tidy and pleasant and comfortable all about one, people cannot even begin to enjoy life. I cannot endure messes.'</i></b>
