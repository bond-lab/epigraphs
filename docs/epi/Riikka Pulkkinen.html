                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Maybe I’m daydreaming.
She makes me think of music.
Her face…
We’re living in the age of the double man.
We no longer need mirrors to talk to ourselves.
When Marianne says “It’s a beautiful day,” what is she thinking about?
All I have is that image of her saying “It’s a beautiful day.”
Nothing else. Is there any point in figuring this out?
We are made of dreams and dreams are made of us.
It’s a beautiful day, my love — in dreams, in words, in death.
It’s a beautiful day, my love— a beautiful day in life.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Pierrot le Fou</i>,  (1965), Film, France/Switzerland
