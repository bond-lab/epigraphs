<li>IN: <i>The Form of Things Unknown</i> (2016) Fiction, Young Adult Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The lunatic, the lover and the poet
Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>A Midsummer's Night Dream</i>,  (1600), Play, UK
