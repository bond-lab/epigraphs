                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the world where we live today, before doing something we must each think; we must think long and hard because what we say heads off on its own -- it doesn't stay here. So when someone comes and asks, "Whos said that?" you will reply with his name, "It was Kaku Adingala who said it." "Really? And where is this Adingala from?" You will say he comes from Siman. Then the person will ask you, "Who is his ancestor?" Maybe he already knows, but you will say, "His ancestor is old Assemian Eci." And then he will reply, "Say no more. What you have said is true."</i></b>
