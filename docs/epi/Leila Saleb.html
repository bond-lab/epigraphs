                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Sometimes one can realize that a person is unworthy of love and love them anyway; one can form an unexplainable attachment that cannot be broken even when the object of one's affection breaks the confidences with which you entrusted them. Sometimes the one you love is blind to your feelings and for all your conversations you cannot find the words to explain it.</i></b>
