There was satisfaction. The network of mind continued to push out into space, from the older stars, the burned-out worlds,
to the young out across the galaxy. Pushed deep in time too, twisting the fate of countless trillions of lives.

To the tail of the peacock

Wings strong, heart stout, mind clear.
God's Engines will burn our ocean
And flame across the lands of spices.

I and my mothers.
Send the Dove west! O, send him west!

Walks west.
The Feathered Serpent, plague-hardened,
Flies over ocean sea,
Flies east.
Serpent and Dragon, the mortal duel
And Serpent feasts on holy flesh.
All this I have witnessed
I and my mothers.
Send the Dove west! O, send him west!</i></b>
