<li>IN: <i>The Skull Beneath the Skin</i> (1982) Fiction, British
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Webster was much possessed by death
And saw the skull beneath the skin;
And breastless creatures under ground
Leaned backward with a lipless grin.

Daffodil bulbs instead of balls
Stared from the sockets of the eyes!
He knew that thought clings round dead limbs
Tightening its lusts and luxuries.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>Whispers of Immortality</i>,  (1919), Poem, UK
