                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>‘I know you’re probably sick of environmentalists like me banging on about global warming. The sea level rising and all that rubbish. But think of it this way. You know the Thames Barrier? You know that without it a lot of central London would be under water? Well, in twenty-five years’ time, if you don’t build a much bigger Thames Barrier, London will be under water anyway. That’s what rising sea levels mean.
‘Twenty-five years; it’s not long, is it? Or, if you’re really unlucky with the weather, it could be twenty-five minutes.’</i></b>
