                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Be to her, Persephone,
 All the things I might not be:
 Take her head upon your knee.
 She that was so proud and wild,
 Flippant, arrogant and free,
 She that had no need of me,
 Is a little lonely child
 Lost in Hell, -- Persephone,
 Take her head upon your knee:
 Say to her, "my dear, my dear,
 It is not so dreadful here."</i></b>
