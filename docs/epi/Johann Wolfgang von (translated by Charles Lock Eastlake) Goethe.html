                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>As yellow is always accompanied with light, so it may be said that blue still brings a principle of darkness with it. The colour has a peculiar and almost indescribable effect on the eye. As a hue it is powerful, but it is on the negative side, and in its highest purity is, as it were, a stimulating negation. Its appearance, then, is a kind of contradiction between excitement and repose.</i></b>
