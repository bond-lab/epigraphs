                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>A glass of prosecco at dawn is romantic. It fizzes with excitement while the morning yawns awake. As the day grows wiser, a flute of sparkling wine adds magic to a lazy afternoon. But when the sky  turns red over the hills and the evening star winks at the possibility of a kiss, nothing surpasses champagne.</i></b>
