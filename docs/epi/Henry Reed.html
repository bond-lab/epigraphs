                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There may be dead ground in between and I may not have got
 The knack of judging a distance; I will only venture 
 A guess that perhaps between me and the apparent lovers
 (Who, incidentally, appear by now to have finished,)
 At seven o'clock from the houses, is roughly a distance
 Of about one year and a half.</i></b>
