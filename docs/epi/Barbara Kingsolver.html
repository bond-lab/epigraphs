<li>IN: <i>The Prodigal Summer</i> (2000) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Come all you who are not satisfied
as ruler in a lone, wallpapered room
full of mute birds, and flowers that falsely bloom,
and closets chosed with dreams that long ago died!

Come let us sweep the old streets - like a bride:
sweep our dead leaves with relentless broom;
prepare for Spring, as though he were our groom
for whose light footstep eargerly we bide.

We'll sweep out shadows, where the rats long fed;
sweet out our shame - and in its place we'll make
a bower for love, a splendid marriage - bed
fragrant with flowers aquiver for the Spring.
And when he comes, our murdered dreams shall wake;
and when he comes, all the mute birds shall sing.</i></b>
