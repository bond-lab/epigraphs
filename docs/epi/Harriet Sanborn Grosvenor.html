<li>IN: <i>Leaving Home: A Story For Boys</i> (1860) Fiction, American
                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Seest thou my home? 'tis where yon woods are waving,
In their dark richness to the summer air;
Where the blue stream, a thousand flower banks laving,
Leads down the hills, a vein of light - 'tis there.

My home! the spirit of its love is breathing,
In every wind that plays across my track;
From its white walls the very tendrils wreathing,
Seem with soft links to draw the wanderer back.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Two Homes</i>,  (1850), Poem, United Kingdom
