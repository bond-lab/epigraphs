                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Chemical agents lend themselves to covert use in sabotage against which it is exceedingly difficult to visualize any really effective defenceâ€¦ I will not dwell upon this use of CBS because, as one pursues the possibilities of such covert uses, one discovers that the scenarios resemble that in which the components of a nuclear weapon are smuggled into New York City and assembled in the basement of the Empire State Building.
In other words, once the possibility is recognized to exist, about all that one can do is worry about it.</i></b>
