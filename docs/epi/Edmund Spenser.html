                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>So oft as I with state of present time,
  The image of the antique world compare,
  When as mans age was in his freshest prime,
  And the first blossome of faire vertue bare,
  Such oddes I finde twixt those, and these which are,
  As that, through long continuance of his course,
  Me seemes the world is runne quite out of square,
  From the first point of his appointed sourse,
And being once amisse growes daily wourse and wourse.

Let none then blame me, if in discipline
  Of vertue and of ciuill vses lore,
  I doe not forme them to the common line
  Of present dayes, which are corrupted sore,
  But to the antique vse, which was of yore,
  When good was onely for it selfe desyred,
  And all men sought their owne, and none no more;
  When Iustice was not for most meed outhyred,
But simple Truth did rayne, and was of all admyred

Dread Souerayne Goddesse, that doest highest sit
  In seate of iudgement, in th'Almighties stead,
  And with magnificke might and wondrous wit
  Doest to thy people righteous doome aread,
  That furthest Nations filles with awfull dread,
  Pardon the boldnesse of thy basest thrall,
  That dare discourse of so diuine a read,
  As thy great iustice praysed ouer all:
The instrument whereof loe here thy Artegall.
