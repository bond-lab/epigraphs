                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Zig, Zig, Zig -- hark! Death beats a measure,
Drums on a tomb with heels hard and thin.
Death plays at night a dance for his pleasure --
Zig, Zig, Zig -- on his old violin.
What are those moans from the lindens betiding?
Dark is the night, and the wind bloweth keen.
Skeletons pallid come out of their hiding,
To dance in their shrouds over tombstone and green.
Zig, Zig, Zig -- how they jostle each other!
List to the rattling of bones as they dance!
But hush! In a twinkling the dancing is over,
Each strives to be foremost -- the cock he hath crowed.</i></b>
