                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>For most of us, there is only the unattended
Moment, the moment in and out of time,
The distraction fit, lost in a shaft of sunlight,
The wild thyme unseen, or the winter lightning
Or the waterfall, ormusic heard so deeply
That is not heard at all, but you are the music
While the music lasts.These are only hints and guesses,
Hints followed by guesses...</i></b>
