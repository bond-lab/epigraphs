                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Cowards have small possibilities.
Fame is not won through silence
and cowards
out of caution
Are at times obliged to show courage.
Thus adders hustle to be hawks:
sensing the way the wind is blowing,
they adapt themselves to courage
just as they had adapted themselves to lies.</i></b>
