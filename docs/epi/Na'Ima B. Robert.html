                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Just so long as you know
That these roads
Are our roads,
So we will fight for these streets;
Yes, we will die for these streets
Because they are the only thing 
That have ever given us a place
In this monarchy,
The closest thing I have to an identity
So yes, I will die to be me - 
I may have been born a pauper
But ya dun know I'ma die a king.</i></b>
