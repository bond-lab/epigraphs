                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>When the morning skies grow red
And o'er their radiance shed,
Thou, O Lord, appeareth in their light.
When the Alps glow bright with splendour,
Pray to God, to Him surrender,
For you feel and understand,
For you feel and understand,
That he dwelleth in this land,
That he dwelleth in this land.</i></b>
