                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>But it is very foolish to ask questions about any young ladies -- about any three sisters just grown up; for one knows, without being told, exactly what they are: all very accomplished and pleasing, and one very pretty.

Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp; and all sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the better for not being taught; or something like it.</i></b>
