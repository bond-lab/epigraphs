                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Unspoken Words from the Beekeeper
 
 I send you love on the wings of a bee
 That jar of honey on your doorstep came from me
 It promises sweetness we both can share,
 And maybe, just maybe, you can learn to share
 
 I bare my arm to the pain of stings,
 To claim the prize that my daring brings
 I'll give my heart just as eagerly
 If one day you'll give yours to me.</i></b>
