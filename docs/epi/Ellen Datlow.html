                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>“Why is your forehead so cool and damp?” she asks.
Her breasts are soft and dry as flour.
The hand that brushes my head is feverish.
At her touch I long for
the slap of water against rocks …
…
“What are you thinking of?” she whispers.
I am staring into the garden.
I am watching the moon
wind its trail of golden slime around the oak,
over the stone basin of the fountain.
How can I tell her
I am thinking that transformations are not forever?</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>From the Journal of the Frog Prince</i>,  (1978), Short story, US
