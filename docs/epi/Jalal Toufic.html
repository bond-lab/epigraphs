                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Human love is implicated with death, because it implies either resurrecting the beloved or following the spouse into the death realm. It is fitting that the lost one is a synonym for the dead one, since the dead are lost de jure and one loses them de facto in the labyrinth. Marriage requires the spouse to follow his wife into the labyrinthe realm of death... To follow them into undeath, as Orpheus did. Orpheus is the model spouse.</i></b>
