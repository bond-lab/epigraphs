                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The modern tropics and their fringes support more than half the world’s population, numbered in the billions. Many already live at the fringe of survival, dependent on food aid transported from the grain belts of more temperate zones. Even a small climatic shift… would physically compress the geographical limits for cereal cropping… I leave it to your imagination what such a pace of climate change would entail for most people.</i></b>
