                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Here Freud and Heidegger I conjoin them within me like the two great ghosts of the "great epoch".
The two surviving grandfathers.
They did not know each other, but according to me they form a couple, and in fact just because of that, this singular anachrony.
They are bound to each other without reading each other and without corresponding.
I have often spoken to you about this situation, and it is this picture that I would like to describe in Le legs: two thinkers whose glances never ctossed and who, without ever receibing a word from one another, say the same.
They are turned to the same side.</i></b>
