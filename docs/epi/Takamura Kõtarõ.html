                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Remember December 8th,
The day world history changed.
The day Anglo-Saxon power
was denied across the land and sea of East Asia.
It was our Japan that denied them,
the small country in the Eastern sea,
the Land of the Gods, Nippon.
Ruled over by a living God.
The power of Anglo-American, 
monopolists of global wealth,
was denied in our own country.
Our denial was our justice.
We only demand the return of East Asia to East Asia.
Our neighbours grow thin from their exploitation.
It is we who will break those claws and fangs.
We who build our strength and rise up.
Young and old, men and women: soldiers all.
We fight until our great enemies see the error of their ways.
World history has been severed in two.
Remember December 8th.</i></b>
