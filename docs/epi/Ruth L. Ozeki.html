                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>One day Lord Korechika, the Minster of the Centre, brought the Empress a bundle of notebooks. "What shall we do with them?" Her Majesty asked me....
"Let me make them into a pillow," I said.
"Very well," said Her Majesty. "You may have them."
I now had a vast quantity of paper at my disposal, and I set about filling the notebooks with odd facts, stories from the past, and all sorts of other things, often including the most trivial material. On the whole I concentrated on things and people that I found charming and splendid, my notes are also full of poems and observations on trees and plants, birds and insects. I was sure that when people saw my book they would say, "It's even worse that I expected. Now one can really tell what she is like." After all, it is written entirely for my own amusement, and I put things down exactly as they came to me....
As will be gathered from these notes of mine, I am the sort of person who approves what others abhor and detests the things they like.</i></b>

It is thought that ages ago there lived somewhere in central Asia a race of white people, now known as Aryans. As the race increased in size large bands roamed about in search of new homes, where they could find pastures for their cattle.</i></b>
