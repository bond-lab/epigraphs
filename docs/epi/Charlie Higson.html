                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>And War, which for a moment was no more, 
Did glut himself again - a meal was bought 
With blood, and each sate sullenly apart 
Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left; 
All earth was but one thought - and that was death, 
Immediate and inglorious; and the pang
Of famine fed upon all entrails - men 
Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh; </i></b>
