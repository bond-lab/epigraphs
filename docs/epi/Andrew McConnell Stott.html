                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Why do you make a book? Because my Hands can extend but few score Inches from my body; because my poverty keeps those Hands empty when my Heart aches to empty them; because my Life is short, and my Infirmities; and beacause a Book, if it extendsbut to one Edition, will probably benefit three or four on whom I could not otherwise have acted... O but think only of the thoughts, feelings, radical Impulses that have been implanted in how many thousands of thousands by the little Ballad of the Children of the Wood! The sphere of Alexander the Great's Agency is trifling compared with it.</i></b>
