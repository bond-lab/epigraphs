                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Who can open the doors of his face? His teeth are terrible round about… By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning … He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. He beholdeth all things: he is a king over all the children of pride. </i></b>
