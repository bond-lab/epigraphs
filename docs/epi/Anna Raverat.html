                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>This being human is a Guest House.
Every morning a new arrival. 

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture.
Still treat each guest honourably.
He may be clearing you out for some new delight.</i></b>
