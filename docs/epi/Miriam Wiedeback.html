                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>It was the storyteller Elina who spoke for the children. 
She sat before the Emperor. 
the Second Lotus Emperor. 
jangled the bells of her bow. 
and sang of girls unwanted. 
of babies left to die. 
of a future where women were scarcer than gold.

And the Emperor listened and hear 
the words of the singer 
and her song of sadness. 
The Emperor listened. 
and he built a city. 

All who wanted could bring their daughters to this place. 
where they would be taught, 
cared for, 
and kept safe.

And the people honored the Emperor for his wisdom.</i></b>
