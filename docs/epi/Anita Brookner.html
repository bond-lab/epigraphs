                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>There is much to be said for the advantage of rules and regulations, much the same thing as can be said in praise of middle-class society - he who sticks to them will never produce anything that is bad or in poor taste, just as he who lets himself be moulded by law, order, and prosperity will never become an intolerable neighbour or a striking scoundrel. On the other hand... rules and regulations ruin our true appreciation of nature and our power to express it.</i></b>
                <br>FROM: <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther</i>,  (1774), Novel, Germany
