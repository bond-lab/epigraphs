is not a Kiss,
in Arlt's many-sided Machine --

Recorder of fireworks,
Fleurs de la banalit√© modernoe
("I am not Hamlet nor was meant to be"),

Parallelpipeda
scraping the skies,
Phantasmagoria in zinc,

"What did you do with my life?"
ask Seven Stooges
seeking their Author --

Hanged puppets
Tin soldiers
Mad toys
sans Sight --

Michele: "And if I accuse the Inventor?"

Arlt: "It's not my fault."</i></b>
