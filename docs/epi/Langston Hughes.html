It was hot as blazes. I didn’t know a soul in the city. But hardly had I climbed into a rickshaw than I saw riding in another along the Bund a Negro who looked exactly like a Harlemite. I stood up in my rickshaw and yelled, “Hey, man!”
He stood up in his rickshaw and yelled, “What ya sayin’?” We passed each other in the crowded street, and I never saw him again.</i></b>

Forgotten about me
When I hear them say they gonna 
Save Democracy.
Funny thing about white folks
Wanting to go and fight
Way over in Europe
For freedom and light
When right here in Alabama --
Lord have mercy on me! -- 
They declare I'm a Fifth Columnist
If I say the word, Free.
Jim Crow all around me.
Don't have the right to vote.
Let's leave our neighbour's eye alone
And look after our own mote -- 
Cause I sure don't understand
What the meaning can be 
When folks talk about freedom --
And Jim Crow me?</i></b>
