                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>On the third day out I get it, the sea 
Is not one thing, it constantly transforms 
Itself, and in unthinking majesty 
Tapestries horizons with sun or storms. 
So then lying now, rocking to and fro 
On its soothing and gentle amniotic swell 
I loosen thoughts of home, and let them go, 
And my shipwrecked heart can start to heal. 
What promise for me, what spirit salve 
When unanchored here I find at last,  
Something has shifted, giving me resolve 
To let hope aboard, jettison the past. 
The sea has given me a chance to live,
And leads us maybe to a safe harbour, love.</i></b>
