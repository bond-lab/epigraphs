                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>Heaven

There is bliss, there is bliss, in the regions above,
They have opened the gates of the sky;
A spirit has soared to those mansions of love,
And seeks for admittance on high;
And friends long divided are hasting to meet
In a land where no sorrow may come,
And seraphs are eager a sister to greet,
And to welcome the child to its home.

There is bliss, there is bliss, at the foot of the throne;
See the spirit, all purified; bend,
And it beams with delight, since it gazes al
On the face of a Father, a Friend!

There it joins in the anthems forever that rise,
Its folly and frailty forgiven;
It is dead to the earth, and new-born to the skies:
And this is the portion of Heaven!</i></b>
