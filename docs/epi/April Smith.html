                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In the woods it is born,
In the pasture it grazes,
In the city it plays,
The living carries the dead
And the dead plays.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>In 1929, Congress enacted legislation that authorized the secretary of war to arrange for pilgrimages to the European cemeteries "by mothers and widows of members of military and naval forces of the United States  who died in the service at any time between April 5, 1917, and July 1, 1921, and whose remains are now interred in such cemeteries." Congress later extended eligibility for pilgrimages to mothers and widows of men who died and were buried at sea or who died at sea or overseas and whose places of burial were unknown. The Office of the Quartermaster General determined that 17,389 women were eligible. By October 31, 1933, when the project ended, 6693 women had made the pilgrimage.</i></b>

                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The pale, cold light of the winter sunset did not beautify -- it was like the light of truth itself. When the smoky clouds hung low in the west and the red sun went down behind them, leaving a pink flush on the snowy roofs and the blue drifts, then the wind sprang up afresh, with a kind of bitter song, as if it said: "This is reality, whether you like it or not. All those frivolities of summer, the light and shadow, the living mask of greent that trembled over everything, they were lies, and this is what was underneath. This is the truth.</i></b>
