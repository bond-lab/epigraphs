                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>I that in heill wes and gladnes,
Am trublit now with gret seiknes,
And feblit with infermitie;
Timormortis conturbat me.
Our plesance here is all vain glory,
This fals world is but transitory,
The flesche is brukle, the Feynd is slee;
Timormortis conturbat me.
The stait of man does change and vary,
Now sound, now seik, now blith, now sary,
Now dansand mery, now like to dee;
Timormortis conturbat me.
No stait in Erd here standis sicker;
As with the wynd wavis the wicker,
Wavis this warldis vanitie;
Timormortis conturbat me.
On to the dead gois all Estatis,
Princis, prelotis, and Potestatis,
Baith rich and pur of all degree;
Timormortis conturbat me.
He sparis no lord for his piscence,
Na clerk for his intelligence;
His awfull straik may no man flee;
Timormortis conturbat me.
Sen he hes all my brether tane,
He will nocht lat me lif alane,
On force I mun his next prey be;
Timormortis conturbat me.</i></b>
