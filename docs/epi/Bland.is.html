                <br>EPIGRAPH: <i><b>The formation of a scar is a natural part of the biological process, which occurs when a lesion to the skin or other body tissue grows after an accident, illness, or surgery. Since the body is unable to create an exact replica of the damaged tissue, the fresh tissue grows with a new texture and properties that differ from the undamaged skin around it. 

The navel is our centre or core and by that we mean the centre of the universe. It is a scar that no longer serves a purpose.</i></b>
