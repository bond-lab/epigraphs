# epigraphs
An API for looking up the epigraph database (and code to make the database)

This contains code to convert the epigraph data created by the project *Digital Mapping the Literary Epigraph: Quantitative analysis of literary influence using network theory and thousands of epigraphs* led by Graham Mathews from 2017 to 2020, funded by the MOE Tier 1 grant at NTU.

The python API is in epigraph.py.

Code to make the database is in makedb.py.  The database itself is in epigraph.db   

Data for mapping countries to canonical names (from geonames) and nationalitilies (from iso-3166) is also provided
